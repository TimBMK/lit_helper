I conclude by pointing to the relative lack of research into the possibility of the deliberative position being realized through cyberspace.

It argues that this understanding of deliberative democracy fails to adequately consider the asymmetries of power through which deliberation and consensus are achieved, the inter-subjective basis of meaning, the centrality of respect for difference in democracy, and the democratic role of `like-minded' deliberative groups.The deliberative public sphere must be rethought to account more fully for these four aspects.

      "The text critiques the liberal-individualist view and argues that a deliberative conception of digital democracy envisions the transformation of private individuals into publicly oriented democratic subjects. In this view, online communication isn’t just about individual expression or aggregating isolated interests but about fostering rational deliberation that cultivates a shared public opinion. This process helps form a public sphere where diverse voices participate in reasoned debate, leading to a consensus that is not pre-given but developed through collective inquiry. In essence, the deliberative approach presents digital democracy as a space where debates and reasoned discussions transform individuals into engaged citizens who scrutinize and influence decision‐making processes for the common good.\n"

      "Here are some additional passages from Dahlberg’s \"Re-Constructing Digital Democracy\" that speak to the notion of the democratic subject within deliberative democratic approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "• On page 4, Dahlberg outlines how discussions about digital democracy often begin by identifying key elements—including the democratic subject assumed. He writes about the range of possibilities digital media might offer, noting that while the liberal-individualist model presupposes fixed, pre-defined subjects, other models (like the deliberative approach) see subjects as emerging through bottom‐up, deliberative practices. In this way, the democratic subject isn’t given in advance but is continuously shaped by dynamic, interactive communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "• On page 5, he argues that “democracy is then based on deliberatively constituted consensus, rather than upon the aggregation of independent instrumental interests.” Here, the idea is that through meeting criteria such as reflexivity, reciprocity, and inclusiveness, everyday communications in digital spaces help transform individuals into deliberative subjects. This means that rather than starting as isolated, predefined citizens, people become politically engaged and develop a shared, rational public opinion through mutual deliberation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, these passages reinforce the view that in deliberative digital democracy the democratic subject is not static. Instead, it is continually reformed through active participation in reasoned debate, ultimately leading to a public sphere that both critiques and directs decision-making processes.\n"
