      "1. **Focus**: Fraser's work focuses on the limitations of liberal democracy and the need for a critical social theory to understand the constraints of democratic participation. In contrast, Jungherr & Schröder's work focuses on the transformations of the public arena, particularly the impact of new media infrastructures.\n",

Jungherr & Schröder's concept of the public arena emphasizes the importance of contestation and the role of media infrastructures in shaping public discourse.\n",
      "3. **Media Infrastructures**: While Fraser does not explicitly discuss media infrastructures, Jungherr & Schröder highlight their significance in constituting the public arena. They argue that digital media infrastructures have transformed the way information is produced, distributed, and consumed, creating new spaces for connecting producers with consumers.\n",
      "4. **Regulation of Media Infrastructures**: Fraser's work does not address the regulation of media infrastructures, whereas Jungherr & Schröder emphasize the need to understand how these infrastructures are regulated and how they impact public discourse.\n",
      "5. **Focus on Contestation**: Both authors highlight the importance of contestation in shaping public discourse.
