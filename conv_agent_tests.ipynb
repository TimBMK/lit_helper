      "\n",
      "1. **Fraser's Critique of the Public Sphere**:\n",
      "   - Fraser critiques the traditional bourgeois conception of the public sphere as outlined by Habermas. She argues that this conception was never fully realized in practice, particularly the claim to open access, which was not achieved (Source: {'page': 4, 'source': 'test_data\\\\Fraser 1990 Rethinking the Public Sphere.pdf', 'start_index': 0}).\n",
      "   - Fraser highlights the exclusionary nature of the public sphere, where inequalities of status were supposed to be bracketed, but in reality, access was limited, and the sphere was dominated by bourgeois norms (Source: {'page': 4, 'source': 'test_data\\\\Fraser 1990 Rethinking the Public Sphere.pdf', 'start_index': 0}).\n",
      "   - She emphasizes the importance of recognizing multiple public spheres, especially for marginalized groups, to allow for diverse discursive interactions and identity formations (Source: {'page': 24, 'source': 'test_data\\\\Fraser 1990 Rethinking the Public Sphere.pdf', 'start_index': 4096}).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Jungherr & Schröder's Concept of the Public Arena**:\n",
      "   - Jungherr & Schröder focus on the transformation of the public arena through digital technologies, which have changed how information is mediated and how political discourses are shaped (Source: {'page': 0, 'source': 'test_data\\\\Jungherr & Schroeder 2021 Digital Transformations of the Public Arena.pdf', 'start_index': 0}).\n",
      "   - They define the public arena as consisting of media infrastructures that enable and constrain the publication, distribution, reception, and contestation of information, mediating the relationship between citizens and political elites (Source: {'page': 8, 'source': 'test_data\\\\Jungherr & Schroeder 2021 Digital Transformations of the Public Arena.pdf', 'start_index': 1665}).\n",
      "   - The public arena is seen as a space for societal conflict and challenges to the status quo, providing opportunities for new voices and challenger parties to emerge (Source: {'page': 62, 'source': 'test_data\\\\Jungherr & Schroeder 2021 Digital Transformations of the Public Arena.pdf', 'start_index': 0}).\n"

    "    -   2 possible solutions: \n",
    "        1) adjust 'query_or_respond' in a way that it decides whether or not to use the retriever tool, but does not edit the query; \n",
    "        2) drop the self-querying retriever (revert back to normal retriever) and adjust 'query_or_respond' in a way that it outputs a structured query (note that this solution would bind the same LLM to the reasoning/decision step and the query construction)\n",
    "    - solution: build a routing agent that replaces 'query_or_respond', as this provides more flexibility, e.g. when addding a web or wikipedia search later (see https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/rag/langgraph_adaptive_rag_local/#components)\n",
    "    - current state: router should be working, but we get an error when it calls the retriever. Seems related to the message state handling.\n",

    "- implement Wikipedia API as retriever tool and modify decision agent\n",
    "- implement Zotero API integration for literature search"
