I have chosen the term affordances as it \\nbroadly captures how all the positions tend to understand the human–technology \\nrelationship. In general terms, the relationship is one where the technology is seen to \\nhave certain features that enable (afford) particular democratic uses and outcomes. 1 \\nFinally, I explored how digital democracy commentary and practice was positioned in \\nrelation to these three immanent, interrelated, and mutually effecting elements. This \\nenabled me to reconstruct  a number of positions, including the four outlined in this \\narticle.2 As interpretatively reconstructed representations of the articulations of empirical \\ninstances, the resulting positions are open to (and indeed invite) challenge and rewriting \\nin digital democracy scholarship. \\nThe empirical material from which I reconstructed the four positions consists of a \\ncombination of e-democracy commentary, academic research, and digital democracy \\npractice. I do not specifically differentiate between ‘theoretical’ and ‘practical’ materials. I \\nsee these as mutually implicated. Practices embody systems of ideas, and such systems are \\nnot only themselves a form of practice but draw from practical experience. Moreover, given \\nthe heterogeneous and ever-changing nature of this material – the ‘set’ of all to do with \\ndigital democracy – ‘representative’ sampling was rejected. Rather, in accord with a critical-\\ninterpretative approach, I drew upon my knowledge and previous research in the field to \\nchoose what I considered exemplary digital democracy texts and practices. My choice of \\nexemplars, as well as my subsequent reading, is necessarily marked by my subjective \\nexperience and judgement, and given ongoing developments in the field invites rereading. \\nI name the four reconstructed positions liberal-individualist, deliberative, counter-\\npublics, and autonomist Marxist. My research indicates that these positions characterize \\nwidely influential understandings in digital democracy rhetoric and practice. However, I do \\nnot claim that they in any way exhaust the e-democracy positions that could be explicated. \\nGiven more space and research resources we could identify and explore a number of other \\ne-democracy articulations, including cyber-feminist (for example, Fernandez et al., 2004; \\nFuller, 2004; Hall, 1996; Plant, 1996), communitarian (see Dahlberg, 2001a), cyber-liber-\\ntarian (see Dahlberg, 2010), liberal digital commonism (for example, Benkler, 2006; Lessig, \\n2001), and postmodern (for example, Nguyen and Alexander, 1996; Poster, 2001). It would \\nalso be interesting to ask if distinct positions could be seen developing out of experiences \\nof subalternity, particularly in relation to the Global South. In addition, we could outline \\nmore cautious, and even dystopian, positions (see Kroker and Kroker, 1997; Kroker and \\nWeinstein, 1994). Moreover, e-democracy would be characterized differently if we were to \\nidentify, and deploy as organizing dimensions, elements immanent to rhetoric and practice \\nother than the three used here (such as those listed above). However, I found the three \\nelements deployed to be central in digital democracy articulations. While necessarily \\nlimited in scope, I believe that the resulting outline brings much needed attention to digital \\ndemocracy’s diversity and provides a framework for further research. \\nLiberal-individualist digital democracy \\nMuch digital democracy discussion and practice draws upon what I refer to as a liberal- \\nindividualist understanding of democracy.

Sometimes the technology is understood more as a ‘tool’ for uses determined by \\nindependent human agents, as in communication conduits or the means for engaging in \\nactivism. At other times digital media are seen more constitutively, as bringing into being \\nparticular spaces, objects, subjects, and practices. One general observation, however, can \\nbe made. This is that the rhetoric and practice of the liberal-individualist position tends \\nto read digital media as most tool-like (able to be developed and deployed at will by \\nindividuals and groups to meet their needs and desires), while the autonomist position \\ntakes the most constitutive understanding, seeing digital communication networks as \\nbringing into existence a new democratic society.

I will briefly outline the democratic \\naffordances offered by digital media that this position highlights, before identifying the \\nassumed democratic subject and associated understanding of democracy. \\nLiberal-individualist digital democracy understands digital media as offering a \\nmeans for the effective transmission of information and viewpoints between individuals \\nand representative decision-making processes (for example, Gore, 1994, in relation to \\nthe early internet, and Chadwick, 2009, in relation to digital social networking develop-\\nments). Digital media are understood here as enabling individuals to gain the informa -\\ntion they need to examine competing political positions and problems, and as providing \\nthem with the means for the registration, and subsequent aggregation (as ‘public opin -\\nion’), of their choices (through e-voting, web feedback systems, petitions, e-mail, \\nonline polls, etc.). \\nThis liberal-individualist position is being advanced through a range of local and \\nnational government e-democracy initiatives (see examples in Chadwick, 2009, and at \\nSteven Clift’s site at http://www.publicus.net/), as well as through commercial sites (for \\nexample, australianpolitics.com, speakout.com, vote.com), corporate media-politics \\nsites (in particular, corporate news sites providing ‘public opinion’ polling and ‘have \\nyour say’ comment systems), ‘independent’ e-democracy projects (for example, calvoter.\\norg, mysociety.org, theglobalvote.org, votinginfoproject.org, vote-smart.org, 2gov.org), \\nand civil society practices (for example, Amnesty International, Avaaz.org, Avaaz’s  \\nparent Moveon.org, and Avaaz’s founding partner Getup!).  In the case of Amnesty \\nInternational, the internet (text, audio, and video) and other digital media (cell phones \\nand video cameras) are deployed as  tools through which liberty-interested individuals \\ncan take action on exposed ‘rights’ violations around the world, transmitting information \\non human rights abuses and providing the means to undertake individual actions (e-mailing \\ngovernment officials, signing e-mail petitions, making electronic donations to appeals, \\nparticipating in online polls, and filing membership applications). \\nThis Amnesty case demonstrates how the international communication enabled by the \\ninternet is being harnessed by certain organizations to extend liberal-individualist demo-\\ncratic actions globally. Avaaz.org, for instance, looms as the largest campaigning organi-\\nzation in history, if one measures size by numbers of individuals virtually participating \\nin its campaigns.

The issue is not\\nwhether economic models indicate the need for austerity policies, but if these\\nmodels account for enough of human life or the boundaries of economic\\nprotection as to be meaningful.\\nThe opposition to experts is already a common feature among populist\\nchallengers and other civil society challengers but it could spread more widely\\nif these crises further increase reliance on expertise that constrain political\\noptions, and media and professional institutions weaken. This opposition ques-\\ntions the legitimacy of experts and scientists to limit the will of the people.\\nOnce peoples’ options in exercising their occupations or personal freedoms\\nbecome narrowed by the say-so of experts and scientists, people will challenge\\ntheir legitimacy. This might not be true for a majority (Bertsou & Caramani\\n2020), especially since the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have led to an\\nincrease in popular trust in scientists. A heavily mobilized, highly intercon-\\nnected critical minority might be enough, however, to mount an effective\\nchallenge. One early example is the“Querdenker” (contrarian thinkers) move-\\nment in Germany, a vocal and increasingly radicalized minority in Germany\\nopposed to the government’s interventions to stop the spread of COVID-19,\\nwhich attacks leading epidemiologists and sees scientists as being in the pocket\\nof Big Pharma. When scientiﬁc epistemologies and expert advice increasingly\\nset the agenda in a consensus-oriented public arena, their position in difﬁcult\\ntimes is bound to be challenged. This atmosphere threatens to unearth the\\ninherent potential conﬂict that emerges between science and democracy when\\nan objective approach to understand and explain the world comes to be seen as\\na “religion of an elite” (Lippman 1928: 39)– in this case a technocratic elite–\\nand accordingly democratically rejected.\\nThe structural tensions of public arenas described above force these conﬂicts\\ninto the open. Just as politicians and journalists before them (Gurri 2018),\\nscientists and experts canﬁnd their institutional standing or authority chal-\\nlenged (Levin 2020) and must face their challengers in the public arena and\\ndefend their epistemologies and conclusions. This is vital and justiﬁed if they\\nexpect for their advice to limit the opportunities, choices, economic prospects,\\nand personal freedoms if followed by governments.3 Western democratic insti-\\ntutions especially may have to get used to the noise and heat of the contempor-\\nary public arena instead of hoping to somehow turn back the clock to\\na centralized and orderly public arena.\\n3 This means also stepping away from fashionable relativistic posturing.

The result of such \\ndiscussion would be \"public opinion\" in the strong sense of a consensus \\nabout the common good. \\nAccording to Habermas, the full utopian potential of the bourgeois \\nconception of the public sphere was never realized in practice.

According to Habermas, \\nthe idea of a public sphere is that of a body of \"private persons\" assem- \\nbled to discuss matters of \"public concern\" or \"common interest.\" This \\nidea acquired force and reality in early modern Europe in the constitution \\nof \"bourgeois publics spheres\" as counterweights to absolutist states. \\nThese publics aimed to mediate between \"society\" and the state by hold- \\ning the state accountable to \"society\" via \"publicity.\" At first this meant'),\n",
