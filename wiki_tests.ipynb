The public sphere can be seen as \"a theater in modern societies in which political participation is enacted through the medium of talk\"  and \"a realm of social life in which public opinion can be formed\".\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nDescribing the emergence of the public sphere in the 18th century, Habermas noted that the public realm, or sphere, originally was \"coextensive with public authority\", while \"the private sphere comprised civil society in the narrower sense, that is to say, the realm of commodity exchange and of social labor\". Whereas the \"sphere of public authority\" dealt with the state, or realm of the police, and the ruling class, or the feudal authorities (church, princes and nobility) the \"authentic \\'public sphere\\'\", in a political sense, arose at that time from within the private realm, specifically, in connection with literary activities, the world of letters. This new public sphere spanned the public and the private realms, and \"through the vehicle of public opinion it put the state in touch with the needs of society\". \"This area is conceptually distinct from the state: it [is] a site for the production and circulation of discourses that can in principle be critical of the state.\" The public sphere \"is also distinct from the official economy; it is not an arena of market relations but rather one of the discursive relations, a theater for debating and deliberating rather than for buying and selling\". These distinctions between \"state apparatuses, economic markets, and democratic associations... are essential to democratic theory\". The people themselves came to see the public sphere as a regulatory institution against the authority of the state. The study of the public sphere centers on the idea of participatory democracy, and how public opinion becomes political action.\\nThe ideology of the public sphere theory is that the government\\'s laws and policies should be steered by the public sphere and that the only legitimate governments are those that listen to the public sphere. \"Democratic governance rests on the capacity of and opportunity for citizens to engage in enlightened debate\". Much of the debate over the public sphere involves what is the basic theoretical structure of the public sphere, how information is deliberated in the public sphere, and what influence the public sphere has over society.\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nJürgen Habermas claims \"We call events and occasions \\'public\\' when they are open to all, in contrast to closed or exclusive affairs\".\\nThis \\'public sphere\\' is a \"realm of our social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed. Access is guaranteed to all citizens\".\\nThis notion of the public becomes evident in terms such as public health, public education, public opinion or public ownership. They are opposed to the notions of private health, private education, private opinion, and private ownership. The notion of the public is intrinsically connected to the notion of the private.\\nHabermas stresses that the notion of the public is related to the notion of the common. For Hannah Arendt, the public sphere is therefore \"the common world\" that \"gathers us together and yet prevents our falling over each other\".\\nHabermas defines the public sphere as a \"society engaged in critical public debate\".\\nConditions of the public sphere are according to Habermas:\\n\\nThe formation of public opinion\\nAll citizens have access\\nConference in unrestricted fashion (based on the freedom of assembly, the freedom of association, the freedom to expression and publication of opinions) about matters of general interest, which implies freedom from economic and political control.\\nDebate over the general rules governing relations.\\n\\n\\n== Jürgen Habermas: bourgeois public sphere ==\\n\\nMost contemporary conceptualizations of the public sphere are based on the ideas expressed in Jürgen Habermas\\' book The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere – An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society, which is a translation of his Habilitationsschrift, Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit:Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft. The German term Öffentlichkeit (public sphere) encompasses a variety of meanings and it implies a spatial concept, the social sites or arenas where meanings are articulated, distributed, and negotiated, as well as the collective body constituted by, and in this process, \"the public\". The work is still considered the foundation of contemporary public sphere theories, and most theorists cite it when discussing their own theories.\\n\\nThe bourgeois public sphere may be conceived above all as the sphere of private people come together as a public; they soon claimed the public sphere regulated from above against the public authorities themselves, to engage them in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labor.\\nThrough this work, he gave a historical-sociological account of the creation, brief flourishing, and demise of a \"bourgeois\" public sphere based on rational-critical debate and discussion: Habermas stipulates that, due to specific historical circumstances, a new civic society emerged in the eighteenth century. Driven by a need for open commercial arenas where news and matters of common concern could be freely exchanged and discussed—accompanied by growing rates of literacy, accessibility to literature, and a new kind of critical journalism—a separate domain from ruling authorities started to evolve across Europe. \"In its clash with the arcane and bureaucratic practices of the absolutist state, the emergent bourgeoisie gradually replaced a public sphere in which the ruler\\'s power was merely represented before the people with a sphere in which state authority was publicly monitored through informed and critical discourse by the people\".\\nIn his historical analysis, Habermas points out three so-called \"\\'institutional criteria\" as preconditions for the emergence of the new public sphere. The discursive arenas, such as Britain\\'s coffee houses, France\\'s salons, and Germany\\'s Tischgesellschaften \"may have differed in the size and compositions of their publics, the style of their proceedings, the climate of their debates, and their topical orientations\", but \"they all organized discussion among people that tended to be ongoing; hence they had a number of institutional criteria in common\":\\n\\nDisregard of status: Preservation of \"a kind of social intercourse that, far from presupposing the equality of status, disregarded status altogether. ... Not that this idea of the public was actually realized in earnest in the coffee houses, salons, and the societies; but as an idea, it had become institutionalized and thereby stated as an objective claim. If not realized, it was at least consequential.\" (loc.  cit.)\\nDomain of common concern: \"... discussion within such a public presupposed the problematization of areas that until then had not been questioned. The domain of \\'common concern\\' which was the object of public critical attention remained a preserve in which church and state authorities had the monopoly of interpretation. ... The private people for whom the cultural product became available as a commodity profaned it inasmuch as they had to determine its meaning on their own (by way of rational communication with one another), verbalize it, and thus state explicitly what precisely in its implicitness for so long could assert its authority.\" (loc. cit.)\\nInclusivity: However exclusive the public might be in any given instance, it could never close itself off entirely and become consolidated as a clique; for it always understood and found itself immersed within a more inclusive public of all private people, persons who – insofar as they were propertied and educated – as readers, listeners, and spectators could avail themselves via the market of the objects that were subject to discussion. The issues discussed became \\'general\\' not merely in their significance, but also in their accessibility: everyone had to be able to participate. ... Wherever the public established itself institutionally as a stable group of discussants, it did not equate itself with the public but at most claimed to act as its mouthpiece, in its name, perhaps even as its educator – the new form of bourgeois representation\" (loc. cit.).\\nHabermas argued that the bourgeois society cultivated and upheld these criteria. The public sphere was well established in various locations including coffee shops and salons, areas of society where various people could gather and discuss matters that concerned them. The coffee houses in London society at this time became the centers of art and literary criticism, which gradually widened to include even the economic and the political disputes as matters of discussion. In French salons, as Habermas says, \"opinion became emancipated from the bonds of economic dependence\". Any new work, or a book or a musical composition had to get its legitimacy in these places. It not only paved a forum for self-expression but in fact had become a platform for airing one\\'s opinions and agendas for public discussion.\\n\\nThe emergence of a bourgeois public sphere was particularly supported by the 18th-century liberal democracy making resources available to this new political class to establish a network of institutions like publishing enterprises, newspapers and discussion forums, and the democratic press was the main tool to execute this. The key feature of this public sphere was its separation from the power of both the church and the government due to its access to a variety of resources, both economic and social.\\nAs Habermas argues, in due course, this sphere of rational and universalistic politics, free from both the economy and the State, was destroyed by the same forces that initially established it. This collapse was due to the consumeristic drive that infiltrated society, so citizens became more concerned about consumption than political actions. Furthermore, the growth of capitalistic economy led to an uneven distribution of wealth, thus widening economic polarity. Suddenly the media became a tool of political forces and a medium for advertising rather than the medium from which the public got their information on political matters. This resulted in limiting access to the public sphere and the political control of the public sphere was inevitable for the modern capitalistic forces to operate and thrive in the competitive economy.\\n\\nTherewith emerged a new sort of influence, i.e., media power, which, used for purposes of manipulation, once and for all took care of the innocence of the principle of publicity. The public sphere, simultaneously restructured and dominated by the mass media, developed into an arena infiltrated by power in which, by means of topic selection and topical contributions, a battle is fought not only over influence but over the control of communication flows that affect behavior while their strategic intentions are kept hidden as much as possible.\\n\\n\\n== Counterpublics, feminist critiques and expansions ==\\nAlthough Structural Transformation was (and is) one of the most influential works in contemporary German philosophy and political science, it took 27 years until an English version appeared on the market in 1989. Based on a conference on the occasion of the English translation, at which Habermas himself attended, Craig Calhoun (1992) edited Habermas and the Public Sphere – a thorough dissection of Habermas\\' bourgeois public sphere by scholars from various academic disciplines. The core criticism at the conference was directed towards the above stated \"institutional criteria\":\\n\\nHegemonic dominance and exclusion: In \"Rethinking the Public Sphere,\" Nancy Fraser offers a feminist revision of Habermas\\' historical description of the public sphere, and confronts it with \"recent revisionist historiography\". She refers to other scholars, like Joan Landes, Mary P. Ryan and Geoff Eley, when she argues that the bourgeois public sphere was in fact constituted by a \"number of significant exclusions.\" In contrast to Habermas\\' assertions on disregard of status and inclusivity, Fraser claims that the bourgeois public sphere discriminated against women and other historically marginalized groups: \"... this network of clubs and associations – philanthropic, civic, professional, and cultural – was anything but accessible to everyone. On the contrary, it was the arena, the training ground and eventually the power base of a stratum of bourgeois men who were coming to see themselves as a \"universal class\" and preparing to assert their fitness to govern.\" Thus, she stipulates a hegemonic tendency of the male bourgeois public sphere, which dominated at the cost of alternative publics (for example by gender, social status, ethnicity and property ownership), thereby averting other groups from articulating their particular concerns.\\nBracketing of inequalities: Fraser makes us recall that \"the bourgeois conception of the public sphere requires bracketing inequalities of status\". The \"public sphere was to be an arena in which interlocutors would set aside such characteristics as a difference in birth and fortune and speak to one another as if they were social and economic peers\". Fraser refers to feminist research by Jane Mansbridge, which notes several relevant \"ways in which deliberation can serve as a mask for domination\". Consequently, she argues that \"such bracketing usually works to the advantage of dominant groups in society and to the disadvantage of subordinates.\" Thus, she concludes: \"In most cases, it would be more appropriate to unbracket inequalities in the sense of explicitly thematizing them – a point that accords with the spirit of Habermas\\' later communicative ethics\".\\nThe problematic definition of \"common concern\": Nancy Fraser points out that \"there are no naturally given, a priori boundaries\" between matters that are generally conceived as private, and ones we typically label as public (i.e. of \"common concern\"). As an example, she refers to the historic shift in the general conception of domestic violence, from previously being a matter of primarily private concern, to now generally being accepted as a common one: \"Eventually, after sustained discursive contestation we succeeded in making it a common concern\".\\n\\nNancy Fraser identified the fact that marginalized groups are excluded from a universal public sphere, and thus it was impossible to claim that one group would, in fact, be inclusive. However, she claimed that marginalized groups formed their own public spheres, and termed this concept a subaltern counter public or counter-public.\\nFraser worked from Habermas\\' basic theory because she saw it to be \"an indispensable resource\" but questioned the actual structure and attempted to address her concerns. She made the observation that \"Habermas stops short of developing a new, post-bourgeois model of the public sphere\". Fraser attempted to evaluate Habermas\\' bourgeois public sphere, discuss some assumptions within his model, and offer a modern conception of the public sphere.\\nIn the historical reevaluation of the bourgeois public sphere, Fraser argues that rather than opening up the political realm to everyone, the bourgeois public sphere shifted political power from \"a repressive mode of domination to a hegemonic one\". Rather than rule by power, there was now rule by the majority ideology. To deal with this hegemonic domination, Fraser argues that repressed groups form \"Subaltern counter-publics\" that are \"parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs\".\\nBenhabib notes that in Habermas\\' idea of the public sphere, the distinction between public and private issues separates issues that normally affect women (issues of \"reproduction, nurture and care for the young, the sick, and the elderly\") into the private realm and out of the discussion in the public sphere. She argues that if the public sphere is to be open to any discussion that affects the population, there cannot be distinctions between \"what is\" and \"what is not\" discussed. Benhabib argues for feminists to counter the popular public discourse in their own counter public.\\nThe public sphere was long regarded as men\\'s domain whereas women were supposed to inhabit the private domestic sphere. A distinct ideology that prescribed separate spheres for women and men emerged during the Industrial Revolution.\\nThe concept of heteronormativity is used to describe the way in which those who fall outside of the basic male/female dichotomy of gender or whose sexual orientations are other than heterosexual cannot meaningfully claim their identities, causing a disconnect between their public selves and their private selves. Michael Warner made the observation that the idea of an inclusive public sphere makes the assumption that we are all the same without judgments about our fellows. He argues that we must achieve some sort of disembodied state in order to participate in a universal public sphere without being judged. His observations point to a homosexual counter public, and offers the idea that homosexuals must otherwise remain \"closeted\" in order to participate in the larger public discourse.\\n\\n\\n== Rhetorical ==\\n\\nGerard Hauser proposed a different direction for the public sphere than previous models. He foregrounds the rhetorical nature of public spheres, suggesting that public spheres form around \"the ongoing dialogue on public issues\" rather than the identity of the group engaged in the discourse.\\nRather than arguing for an all-inclusive public sphere, or the analysis of tension between public spheres, he suggested that publics were formed by active members of society around issues. They are a group of interested individuals who engage in vernacular discourse about a specific issue. \"Publics may be repressed, distorted, or responsible, but any evaluation of their actual state requires that we inspect the rhetorical environment as well as the rhetorical act out of which they evolved, for these are the conditions that constitute their individual character\". These people formed rhetorical public spheres that were based in discourse, not necessarily orderly discourse but any interactions whereby the interested public engages each other. This interaction can take the form of institutional actors as well as the basic \"street rhetoric\" that \"open[s] a dialogue between competing factions.\" The spheres themselves formed around the issues that were being deliberated. The discussion itself would reproduce itself across the spectrum of interested publics \"even though we lack personal acquaintance with all but a few of its participants and are seldom in contexts where we and they directly interact, we join these exchanges because they are discussing the same matters\". In order to communicate within the public sphere, \"those who enter any given arena must share a reference world for their discourse to produce awareness for shared interests and public opinions about them\". This world consists of common meanings and cultural norms from which interaction can take place.\\n\\nThe rhetorical public sphere has several primary features:\\n\\nit is discourse-based, rather than class-based.\\nthe critical norms are derived from actual discursive practices. Taking a universal reasonableness out of the picture, arguments are judged by how well they resonate with the population that is discussing the issue.\\nintermediate bracketing of discursive exchanges. Rather than a conversation that goes on across a population as a whole, the public sphere is composed of many intermediate dialogs that merge later on in the discussion.\\nThe rhetorical public sphere was characterized by five rhetorical norms from which it can be gauged and criticized. How well the public sphere adheres to these norms determine the effectiveness of the public sphere under the rhetorical model. Those norms are:\\n\\npermeable boundaries: Although a public sphere may have a specific membership as with any social movement or deliberative assembly, people outside the group can participate in the discussion.\\nactivity: Publics are active rather than passive. They do not just hear the issue and applaud, but rather they actively engage the issue and the publics surrounding the issue.\\ncontextualized language: They require that participants adhere to the rhetorical norm of contextualized language to render their respective experiences intelligible to one another.\\nbelievable appearance: The public sphere must appear to be believable to each other and the outside public.\\ntolerance: In order to maintain a vibrant discourse, others opinions need to be allowed to enter the arena.\\nIn all this Hauser believes a public sphere is a \"discursive space in which strangers discuss issues they perceive to be of consequence for them and their group. Its rhetorical exchanges are the bases for shared awareness of common issues, shared interests, tendencies of extent and strength of difference and agreement, and self-constitution as a public whose opinions bear on the organization of society.\"\\nThis concept that the public sphere acts as a medium in which public opinion is formed as analogous to a lava lamp. Just as the lamp\\'s structure changes, with its lava separating and forming new shapes, so does the public sphere\\'s creation of opportunities for discourse to address public opinion, thereby forming new discussions of rhetoric. The lava of the public which holds together the public arguments is the public conversation.\\n\\n\\n== Media ==\\nHabermas argues that the public sphere requires \"specific means for transmitting information and influencing those who receive it\".\\nHabermas\\' argument shows that the media are of particular importance for constituting and maintaining a public sphere.  Discussions about the media have therefore been of particular importance in public sphere theory.\\n\\n\\n=== As actors in the political public sphere ===\\nAccording to Habermas, there are two types of actors without whom no political public sphere could be put to work: professionals in the media system and politicians.\\nFor Habermas, there are five types of actors who make their appearance on the virtual stage of an established public sphere:\\n\\n(a) Lobbyists who represent special interest groups;\\n(b) Advocates who either represent general interest groups or substitute for a lack of representation of marginalized groups that are unable to voice their interests effectively;\\n(c) Experts who are credited with professional or scientific knowledge in some specialized area and are invited to give advice;\\n(d) Moral entrepreneurs who generate public attention for supposedly neglected issues;\\n\\n(e) Intellectuals who have gained, unlike advocates or moral entrepreneurs, a perceived personal reputation in some field (e.g., as writers or academics) and who engage, unlike experts and lobbyists, spontaneously in public discourse with the declared intention of promoting general interests.\\nLibraries have been inextricably tied to educational institutions in the modern era having developed within democratic societies. Libraries took on aspects of the public sphere (as did classrooms), even while public spheres  transformed in the macro sense. These contextual conditions  led to a fundamental conservative rethinking of civil society institutions like schools and libraries.\\n\\n\\n=== YouTube ===\\nHabermas argues that under certain conditions, the media act to facilitate discourse in a public sphere. The rise of the Internet has brought about a resurgence of scholars applying theories of the public sphere to Internet technologies.\\nFor example, a study by S. Edgerly et al.\\nfocused on the ability of YouTube to serve as an online public sphere. The researchers examined a large sample of video comments using the California Proposition 8 (2008) as an example. The authors argue that some scholars think the online public sphere is a space where a wide range of voices can be expressed due to the \"low barrier of entry\" and interactivity. However, they also point at a number of limitations. Edgerly et al. say that the affirmative discourse presupposes that YouTube can be an influential player in the political process and that it can serve as an influential force to politically mobilize young people. YouTube has allowed anyone and everyone to be able to get any political knowledge they wish. The authors mention critiques that say YouTube is built around the popularity of videos with sensationalist content. It has also allowed people to broadcast themselves for a large public sphere, where people can form their own opinions and discuss different things in the comments. The research by Edgerly, et al. found that the analyzed YouTube comments were diverse. They argue that this is a possible indicator that YouTube provides space for public discussion. They also found that YouTube videos\\' style influences the nature of the commentary. Finally, they concluded that the video\\'s ideological stances influenced the language of the comments. The findings of the work suggest that YouTube is a public sphere platform.\\nAdditional work by S. Buckley  reflected on the role that news content, specifically US cable news, contributed towards the formation of the public sphere. His research analysed a total of 1239 videos uploaded by five news organisations and investigated the link between content and user engagement. Through both content and sentiment analysis, it was suggested that the sentiment of the language used in the titles of the videos had an impact upon the public, with negatively sentimented titles generated more user engagement. Buckley suggested that due to the aspect of emotionality that is present in news content that due to the ongoing process of media hybridization, a new conceptual framework of the public sphere that acknowledges how both thoughtful discussions as well as ones which express feelings in an overt way needs to be developed.\\n\\n\\n=== Limitations of media and the internet ===\\nSome, like Colin Sparks, note that a new global public sphere ought to be created in the wake of increasing globalization and global institutions, which operate at the supranational level. However, the key questions for him were, whether any media exists in terms of size and access to fulfil this role. The traditional media, he notes, are close to the public sphere in this true sense. Nevertheless, limitations are imposed by the market and concentration of ownership. At present, the global media fail to constitute the basis of a public sphere for at least three reasons. Similarly, he notes that the internet, for all its potential, does not meet the criteria for a public sphere and that unless these are \"overcome, there will be no sign of a global public sphere\".\\nGerman scholars Jürgen Gerhards and Mike S. Schäfer conducted a study in 2009 in order to establish whether the Internet offers a better and broader communication environment compared to quality newspapers. They analyzed how the issue of human genome research was portrayed between 1999 and 2001 in popular quality newspapers in both Germany and the United States in comparison to the way it appeared on search engines at the time of their research. Their intention was to analyze what actors and what sort of opinions the subject generated in both print and the Internet and verify whether the online space proved to be a more democratic public sphere, with a wider range of sources and views. Gerhards and Schäfer say they have found \"only minimal evidence to support the idea that the internet is a better communication space as compared to print media\". \"In both media, communication is dominated by (bio- and natural) scientific actors; popular inclusion does not occur\". The scholars argue that the search algorithms select the sources of information based on the popularity of their links. \"Their gatekeeping, in contrast to the old mass media, relies mainly on technical characteristics of websites\".   For Gerhards and Schäfer the Internet is not an alternative public sphere because less prominent voices end up being silenced by the search engines\\' algorithms. \"Search engines might actually silence societal debate by giving more space to established actors and institutions\". Another tactic that supports this view is astroturfing. The Guardian columnist George Monbiot said that Astroturfing software, \"has the potential to destroy the internet as a forum for constructive debate. It jeopardizes the notion of online democracy\".\\n\\n\\n=== Virtual ===\\nThere has been an academic debate about how social media impacts the public sphere. The sociologists Brian Loader and Dan Mercea give an overview of this discussion. They argue that social media offers increasing opportunities for political communication and enable democratic capacities for political discussion within the virtual public sphere. The effect would be that citizens could challenge governments and corporations\\' political and economic power. Additionally, new forms of political participation and information sources for the users emerge with the Internet that can be used, for example, in online campaigns.\\nHowever, the two authors point out that social media\\'s dominant uses are entertainment, consumerism, and content sharing among friends. Loader and Mercea point out that \"individual preferences reveal an unequal spread of social ties with a few giant nodes such as Google, Yahoo, Facebook and YouTube attracting the majority of users\". They also stress that some critics have voiced the concern that there is a lack of seriousness in political communication on social media platforms. Moreover, lines between professional media coverage and user-generated content would blur on social media.\\nThe authors conclude that social media provides new opportunities for political participation; however, they warn users of the risks of accessing unreliable sources. The Internet impacts the virtual public sphere in many ways, but is not a free utopian platform as some observers argued at the beginning of its history.\\n\\n\\n=== Mediated publicness ===\\nJohn Thompson criticises the traditional idea of public sphere by Habermas, as it is centred mainly in face-to-face interactions. On the contrary, Thompson argues that modern society is characterized by a new form of \"mediated publicness\", whose main characteristics are:\\n\\nDespatialized (there is a rupture of time/space. People can see more things, as they do not need to share the same physical location, but this extended vision always has an angle, which people do not have control over).\\nNon dialogical (unidirectional. For example, presenters on TV are not able to adapt their discourse to the reactions of the audience, since they are visible to a wide audience but that audience is not directly visible to them. However, internet allows a bigger interactivity).\\nWider and more diverse audiences. (The same message can reach people with different education, different social class, different values and beliefs, and so on.)\\nThis mediated publicness has altered the power relations in a way in which not only the many are visible to the few but the few can also now see the many:\\n\\n \"Whereas the Panopticon renders many people visible to a few and enables power to be exercised over the many by subjecting them to a state of permanent visibility, the development of communication media provides a means by which many people can gather information about a few and, at the same time, a few can appear before many; thanks to the media, it is primarily those who exercise power, rather than those over whom power is exercised, who are subjected to a certain kind of visibility\".  \\nHowever, Thompson also acknowledges that \"media and visibility is a double-edged sword\" meaning that even though they can be used to show an improved image (by managing the visibility), individuals are not in full control of their self-presentation. Mistakes, gaffes or scandals are now recorded therefore they are harder to deny, as they can be replayed by the media.\\n\\n\\n=== The public service model ===\\nExamples of the public service model include BBC in Britain, and the ABC and SBS in Australia. The political function and effect of modes of public communication has traditionally continued with the dichotomy between Hegelian State and civil society. The dominant theory of this mode includes the liberal theory of the free press. However, the public service, state-regulated model, whether publicly or privately funded, has always been seen not as a positive good but as an unfortunate necessity imposed by the technical limitations of frequency scarcity.\\nAccording to Habermas\\'s concept of the public sphere,  the strength of this concept is that it identifies and stresses the importance for democratic politics of a sphere distinct from the economy and the State. On the other hand, this concept challenges the liberal free press tradition form the grounds of its materiality, and it challenges the Marxist critique of that tradition from the grounds of the specificity of politics as well.\\nFrom Garnham\\'s critique, three great virtues of Habermas\\'s public sphere are mentioned. Firstly, it focuses on the indissoluble like between the institutions and practices of mass public communication and the institutions and practices of democratic politics. The second virtue of Habermas\\'s approach concentrate on the necessary material resource base for ant public. Its third virtue is to escape from the simple dichotomy of free market versus state control that dominates so much thinking about media policy.\\n\\n\\n== Non-liberal theories ==\\nOskar Negt & Alexander Kluge  took a non-liberal view of public spheres, and argued that Habermas\\' reflections on the bourgeois public sphere should be supplemented with reflections on the proletarian public spheres and the public spheres of production.\\n\\n\\n=== Proletarian ===\\nThe distinction between bourgeois and proletarian public spheres is not mainly a distinction between classes. The proletarian public sphere is rather to be conceived of as the \"excluded\", vague, unarticulated impulses of resistance or resentment. The proletarian public sphere carries the subjective feelings, the egocentric malaise with the common public narrative, interests that are not socially valorized\\n\\n\"As extraeconomic interests, they exist—precisely in the forbidden zones of fantasy beneath the surface of taboos—as stereotypes of a proletarian context of living that is organized in a merely rudimentary form.\"\\nThe bourgeois and proletarian public spheres are mutually defining: The proletarian public sphere carries the \"left-overs\" from the bourgeois public sphere, while the bourgeois public is based upon the productive forces of the underlying resentment:\\n\\n\"In this respect, they \" [i.e. the proletarian public spheres] \" have two characteristics: in their defensive attitude toward society, their conservatism, and their subcultural character, they are once again mere objects; but they are, at the same time, the block of real life that goes against the valorization interest. As long as capital is dependent on living labor as a source of wealth, this element of the proletarian context of living cannot be extinguished through repression.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Production ===\\nNegt and Kluge furthermore point out the necessity of considering a third dimension of the public spheres: The public spheres of production. The public spheres of production collect the impulses of resentment and instrumentalizes them in the productive spheres. The public spheres of production are wholly instrumental and have no critical impulse (unlike the bourgeois and proletarian spheres). The interests that are incorporated in the public sphere of production are given capitalist shape, and questions of their legitimately are thus neutralized.\\n\\n\\n=== Biopolitical public ===\\nBy the end of the 20th century, the discussions about public spheres got a new biopolitical twist. Traditionally the public spheres had been contemplated as to how free agents transgress the private spheres. Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have, drawing on the late Michel Foucault\\'s writings on biopolitics, suggested that we reconsider the very distinction between public and private spheres. They argue that the traditional distinction is founded on a certain (capitalist) account of property that presupposes clear-cut separations between interests. This account of property is (according to Hardt and Negri) based upon a scarcity economy. The scarcity economy is characterized by an impossibility of sharing the goods. If \"agent A\" eats the bread, \"agent B\" cannot have it. The interests of agents are thus, generally, clearly separated.\\nHowever, with the evolving shift in the economy towards an informational materiality, in which value is based upon the informational significance, or the narratives surrounding the products, the clear-cut subjective separation is no longer obvious. Hardt and Negri see the open source approaches as examples of new ways of co-operation that illustrate how economic value is not founded upon exclusive possession, but rather upon collective potentialities. Informational materiality is characterized by gaining value only through being shared. Hardt and Negri thus suggest that the commons become the focal point of analyses of public relations. The point being that with this shift it becomes possible to analyse how the very distinctions between the private and public are evolving.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nArgumentation theory\\nCommons\\nInterpersonal relationship\\nOnline deliberation\\nProtest\\nPublic place\\nProject for Public Spaces\\nPublic hypersphere\\nThe Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article (1964)\\nRes publica\\nRule according to higher law\\nRichard Sennett\\nThe Lives of Others – A film that describes the monitoring of the cultural scene of East Berlin by agents of the Stasi during the Cold War\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nPublic Sphere Guide, a research and teaching guide, and resource for the renewal of the Public Sphere\\nTransformations of the Public Sphere Essay Forum\\nJürgen Habermas, \"The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article,\" New German Critique 3 (1974)\\nSpark summary of Habermas\\' public sphere book'),\n",

An important contribution to modern understanding of democracy, it is notable for \"transforming media studies into a hard-headed discipline.\" In 2022 Habermas published a brief sequel, A New Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere and Deliberative Politics.\\n\\n\\n== The public sphere ==\\nAccording to Habermas, the notion of the \"public sphere\" began evolving during the Renaissance in Western Europe. Brought on partially by merchants\\' need for accurate information about distant markets as well as by the growth of democracy and individual liberty and popular sovereignty, the public sphere was a place between private individuals and government authorities in which people could meet and have critical debates about public matters. Such discussions served as a counterweight to political authority and happened physically in face-to-face meetings in coffee houses and cafes and public squares as well as in the media in letters, books, drama, and art. Habermas saw a vibrant public sphere as a positive force keeping authorities within bounds lest their rulings be ridiculed. According to the journalist David Randall, \"In Habermasian theory, the bourgeois public sphere was preceded by a literary public sphere whose favored genres revealed the interiority of the self and emphasized an audience-oriented subjectivity.\" \\n\\n\\n== Habermas\\' thesis ==\\n\\nThe Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere was Habermas\\'s first major work. It also satisfied the rigorous requirements for a professorship in Germany; in this system, independent scholarly research, usually resulting in a published book, must be submitted, and defended before an academic committee; this process is known as Habilitationsschrift or habilitation. The work was overseen by the political scientist Wolfgang Abendroth, to whom Habermas dedicated it. Habermas describes the development of a bourgeois public sphere in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries as well as its subsequent decline.\\nThe first transition occurred in England, France, the United States, and Germany over the course of 150 years or so from the late seventeenth century. England led the way in the early eighteenth century, with Germany following in the late eighteenth century. Habermas tries to explain the growth and decline of the public sphere by relating political, social, cultural and philosophical developments to each other in a multi-disciplinary approach. Initially, there were monarchical and feudal societies which made no distinction between state and society or between public and private, and which had organized themselves politically around symbolic representation and status. These feudal societies were transformed into a bourgeois liberal constitutional order which distinguished between the public and private realms; further, within the private realm, there was a bourgeois public sphere for rational-critical political debate which formed a new phenomenon called public opinion. Spearheading this shift was the growth of a literary public sphere in which the bourgeoisie learned to critically reflect upon itself and its role in society. This first major shift occurred alongside the rise of early non-industrial capitalism and the philosophical articulation of political liberalism by such thinkers as Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu (See: The Spirit of the Laws), Rousseau, and then Kant. The bourgeois public sphere flourished within the early laissez-faire, free-market, largely pre-industrial capitalist order of liberalism from the late eighteenth century to the mid-nineteenth century.\\nThe second part of Habermas\\' account traces the transition from the liberal bourgeois public sphere to the modern mass society of the social welfare state. Starting in the 1830s, extending from the late nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, a new constellation of social, cultural, political, and philosophical developments took shape. Hegel\\'s critique of Kant\\'s liberal philosophy anticipated the shift, according to Habermas, and this shift came to a philosophical head in Marx\\'s astute diagnosis of the contradictions inherent in the liberal constitutional social order. Habermas saw the modified liberalism of Mill and Tocqueville with their ambivalence toward the public sphere as emblematic manifestations of these contradictions.\\nParalleling this philosophical progression against classical liberalism were major socio-economic transformations based on industrialization, and the result was the rise of mass societies characterized by consumer capitalism in the twentieth century. Clear demarcations between public and private and between state and society became blurred. The bourgeois public sphere was transformed by the increasing re-integration and entwining of state and society that resulted in the modern social welfare state. This shift, according to Habermas, can be seen as part of a larger dialectic in which political changes were made in an attempt to save the liberal constitutional order, but had the ultimate effect of destroying the bourgeois public sphere. He highlights the pernicious effects of commercialization and consumerization on the public sphere through the rise of mass media, public relations, and consumer culture. He delineates how these developments thwarted rational-critical political debate, including political parties functioning in a way that bypassed the public sphere, undermining parliamentary politics.\\nHabermas drew on the cultural critiques of critical theory from the Frankfurt School, which included important thinkers such as Theodor Adorno, who was one of his teachers at the Institute for Social Research from 1956 to 1959. Habermas began his habilitation during this period, but due to intellectual tensions with the Institute\\'s director, philosopher and sociologist Max Horkheimer, he moved to the University of Marburg, where he completed the work under Wolfgang Abendroth.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n The book was reprinted many times in German and other languages, and has been enormously influential, especially since its translation into English, for scholars of political science, media studies, and rhetoric. It is also an important work for historians of philosophy and scholars of intellectual history. After publication, Habermas was identified as an important philosopher of the twentieth century.\\nSince publication, the Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere has been critiqued for Habermas’s formulation of the concept of a public sphere which he claimed \"stood or fell with the principle of universal access ... A public sphere from which specific groups would be eo ipso excluded was less than merely incomplete; it was not a public sphere at all.\" (Habermas 1962:85) However, the bourgeois public sphere required as preconditions of entry an excellent education and property ownership – which correlated to membership of the upper classes. Critics have argued that the bourgeois public sphere cannot be considered an ideal form of politics, since the public sphere was limited to upper-class strata of society and did not represent most of the citizens in these emerging nation-states.\\nSome critics claim the public sphere, as such, never existed, or existed only in the sense of excluding many important groups, such as the poor, women, slaves, migrants, and criminals. They maintain that the public sphere remains an idealized conception, little changed since Kant, since the ideal is still to a great extent what Habermas might call an unfinished project of modernity. (Cubitt 2005:93)\\nSimilar critiques regarding the exclusivity of the bourgeois public sphere have been made by feminist and post-colonial authors.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\nHabermas, Jürgen (1962 trans 1989) The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a category of Bourgeois Society, Polity, Cambridge.

Through these events, students are challenged to practice civic engagement and civil discourse.\\n\\n\\n== Theoretical foundations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Public sphere theory ===\\nPublic sphere pedagogy is theoretically grounded in Jürgen Habermas\\' conceptualization of the public sphere.  In his seminal work The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, Habermas envisioned the public sphere as an inclusive discursive space in which the citizens of a society gathered, discussed, and debated over the issues of the day. Habermas argued that the European bourgeois public sphere that emerged in eighteenth century coffee houses and salons represented an idealized form of the public sphere. Individuals engaging in discussion in these spaces would share and debate their views with one another. Habermas argues that this dialectic encounter was a critical part of one\\'s social life where individuals, as part of a larger public, could construct public opinion through critical rational discourse. Habermas argued that these discussions served to fill the gap between the state and the people by creating what he called a \"civil society\". Further, Habermas argued that a functioning public sphere was critical to maintaining a healthy democratic order and deliberative democracy.\\nThis traditional notion of a face-to-face public sphere has evolved with the invention of online technologies. The public sphere no longer requires a physical setting, but can manifest in cyberspace. The coffee house discussions idealized by Habermas have expanded to blogs, discussion forums, and online videos. Henry Giroux in particular discusses the role of new media in the public sphere and public pedagogy. However, scholars debate whether computer-mediated communication in an online setting actually constitutes a functioning public sphere or just a public space.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\n\\n\\n=== The Town Hall Meeting ===\\nTown Hall Meetings are one way public sphere pedagogy has been integrated into curriculum. This event began at California State University, Chico in 2007. Classes participating in the Town Hall event require students to research and write about controversial issues. Students then come together with classmates, students from other classes, faculty, and community members. During the Town Hall Meeting, participants move into breakout sessions to share their work and engage in discussions about their topics. Faculty and community members moderate these discussions, share expert insight, and move students toward further development of their work.\\n\\n\\n=== The Great Debate ===\\nThe Great Debate also uses public sphere pedagogy as its foundation. This event started at California State University, Chico in 2010 and has since been implemented at Butte College, Shasta College, and Chabot College. The Great Debate requires students from a variety of classes to research and write about a controversial theme. These themes have ranged from water and agriculture to mental health. The event is open to the public. Students give individual and group presentations, engage in formal debates, break out into discussion sessions, and display interactive poster presentations. Community members and public officials also participate as moderators, discussion leaders, and debaters. Unlike the Town Hall Meetings, which usually take place on campus property, the Great Debate is hosted in public spaces including City Council Chambers and public libraries.\\n\\n\\n=== The Student Voices program ===\\nStudent Voices programs are a type of civic engagement initiative that have been implemented in several high schools in the United States. The curriculum has high school students research and complete classroom assignments on current issues in government and candidates in local elections. Students then connect with outside communities via the digital public sphere and engage in moderated \"Speak Out\" events. Student Voices programs have been successfully implemented in curricula in Seattle and Pennsylvania school districts.\\n\\n\\n== Critiques ==\\nPublic sphere pedagogy inherently is subject to many of the criticisms of Habermas\\' conception of the public sphere.  Chief among them is the traditionally exclusionary nature. The bourgeois public sphere, as introduced by Habermas, has been characterized as highly patriarchal, and oblivious to the existence of female and plebeian styles of discourse. The concern here is that as a model of the bourgeois public sphere, applications of public sphere pedagogy might alienate students and community members unaccustomed to this type of dialectic experience. In addition to its exclusionary nature, attention has also been called  to Habermas\\' privileging of a hegemonic public sphere. Michael Warner argues  that the bourgeois public sphere was structured to be affable to those privileged few who made up the powerful upperclass. While students participating in public sphere pedagogy application receive special training in their classrooms, the same is not necessarily true of community members who participate. This specialized student training draws two critiques. First, conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of instruction risks erasing the plurality that is central to being a public. Training individuals how to be \"good\" citizens prescribes action in a way that limits the scope of politics and the public sphere. Second, conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of learning risks eclipsing politics with education. Turning political and social issues into learning problems individualizes the issues instead of making them the responsibility of the public.\\n\\n\\n== References ==')]"

Whereas the \"sphere of public authority\" dealt with the state, or realm of the police, and the ruling class, or the feudal authorities (church, princes and nobility) the \"authentic \\'public sphere\\'\", in a political sense, arose at that time from within the private realm, specifically, in connection with literary activities, the world of letters. This new public sphere spanned the public and the private realms, and \"through the vehicle of public opinion it put the state in touch with the needs of society\". \"This area is conceptually distinct from the state: it [is] a site for the production and circulation of discourses that can in principle be critical of the state.\" The public sphere \"is also distinct from the official economy; it is not an arena of market relations but rather one of the discursive relations, a theater for debating and deliberating rather than for buying and selling\". These distinctions between \"state apparatuses, economic markets, and democratic associations... are essential to democratic theory\". The people themselves came to see the public sphere as a regulatory institution against the authority of the state. The study of the public sphere centers on the idea of participatory democracy, and how public opinion becomes political action.\\nThe ideology of the public sphere theory is that the government\\'s laws and policies should be steered by the public sphere and that the only legitimate governments are those that listen to the public sphere. \"Democratic governance rests on the capacity of and opportunity for citizens to engage in enlightened debate\". Much of the debate over the public sphere involves what is the basic theoretical structure of the public sphere, how information is deliberated in the public sphere, and what influence the public sphere has over society.\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nJürgen Habermas claims \"We call events and occasions \\'public\\' when they are open to all, in contrast to closed or exclusive affairs\".\\nThis \\'public sphere\\' is a \"realm of our social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed. Access is guaranteed to all citizens\".\\nThis notion of the public becomes evident in terms such as public health, public education, public opinion or public ownership. They are opposed to the notions of private health, private education, private opinion, and private ownership. The notion of the public is intrinsically connected to the notion of the private.\\nHabermas stresses that the notion of the public is related to the notion of the common. For Hannah Arendt, the public sphere is therefore \"the common world\" that \"gathers us together and yet prevents our falling over each other\".\\nHabermas defines the public sphere as a \"society engaged in critical public debate\".\\nConditions of the public sphere are according to Habermas:\\n\\nThe formation of public opinion\\nAll citizens have access\\nConference in unrestricted fashion (based on the freedom of assembly, the freedom of association, the freedom to expression and publication of opinions) about matters of general interest, which implies freedom from economic and political control.\\nDebate over the general rules governing relations.\\n\\n\\n== Jürgen Habermas: bourgeois public sphere ==\\n\\nMost contemporary conceptualizations of the public sphere are based on the ideas expressed in Jürgen Habermas\\' book The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere – An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society, which is a translation of his Habilitationsschrift, Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit:Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft. The German term Öffentlichkeit (public sphere) encompasses a variety of meanings and it implies a spatial concept, the social sites or arenas where meanings are articulated, distributed, and negotiated, as well as the collective body constituted by, and in this process, \"the public\". The work is still considered the foundation of contemporary public sphere theories, and most theorists cite it when discussing their own theories.\\n\\nThe bourgeois public sphere may be conceived above all as the sphere of private people come together as a public; they soon claimed the public sphere regulated from above against the public authorities themselves, to engage them in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labor.\\nThrough this work, he gave a historical-sociological account of the creation, brief flourishing, and demise of a \"bourgeois\" public sphere based on rational-critical debate and discussion: Habermas stipulates that, due to specific historical circumstances, a new civic society emerged in the eighteenth century. Driven by a need for open commercial arenas where news and matters of common concern could be freely exchanged and discussed—accompanied by growing rates of literacy, accessibility to literature, and a new kind of critical journalism—a separate domain from ruling authorities started to evolve across Europe. \"In its clash with the arcane and bureaucratic practices of the absolutist state, the emergent bourgeoisie gradually replaced a public sphere in which the ruler\\'s power was merely represented before the people with a sphere in which state authority was publicly monitored through informed and critical discourse by the people\".\\nIn his historical analysis, Habermas points out three so-called \"\\'institutional criteria\" as preconditions for the emergence of the new public sphere. The discursive arenas, such as Britain\\'s coffee houses, France\\'s salons, and Germany\\'s Tischgesellschaften \"may have differed in the size and compositions of their publics, the style of their proceedings, the climate of their debates, and their topical orientations\", but \"they all organized discussion among people that tended to be ongoing; hence they had a number of institutional criteria in common\":\\n\\nDisregard of status: Preservation of \"a kind of social intercourse that, far from presupposing the equality of status, disregarded status altogether. ... Not that this idea of the public was actually realized in earnest in the coffee houses, salons, and the societies; but as an idea, it had become institutionalized and thereby stated as an objective claim. If not realized, it was at least consequential.\" (loc.  cit.)\\nDomain of common concern: \"... discussion within such a public presupposed the problematization of areas that until then had not been questioned. The domain of \\'common concern\\' which was the object of public critical attention remained a preserve in which church and state authorities had the monopoly of interpretation. ... The private people for whom the cultural product became available as a commodity profaned it inasmuch as they had to determine its meaning on their own (by way of rational communication with one another), verbalize it, and thus state explicitly what precisely in its implicitness for so long could assert its authority.\" (loc. cit.)\\nInclusivity: However exclusive the public might be in any given instance, it could never close itself off entirely and become consolidated as a clique; for it always understood and found itself immersed within a more inclusive public of all private people, persons who – insofar as they were propertied and educated – as readers, listeners, and spectators could avail themselves via the market of the objects that were subject to discussion. The issues discussed became \\'general\\' not merely in their significance, but also in their accessibility: everyone had to be able to participate. ... Wherever the public established itself institutionally as a stable group of discussants, it did not equate itself with the public but at most claimed to act as its mouthpiece, in its name, perhaps even as its educator – the new form of bourgeois representation\" (loc. cit.).\\nHabermas argued that the bourgeois society cultivated and upheld these criteria. The public sphere was well established in various locations including coffee shops and salons, areas of society where various people could gather and discuss matters that concerned them. The coffee houses in London society at this time became the centers of art and literary criticism, which gradually widened to include even the economic and the political disputes as matters of discussion. In French salons, as Habermas says, \"opinion became emancipated from the bonds of economic dependence\". Any new work, or a book or a musical composition had to get its legitimacy in these places. It not only paved a forum for self-expression but in fact had become a platform for airing one\\'s opinions and agendas for public discussion.\\n\\nThe emergence of a bourgeois public sphere was particularly supported by the 18th-century liberal democracy making resources available to this new political class to establish a network of institutions like publishing enterprises, newspapers and discussion forums, and the democratic press was the main tool to execute this. The key feature of this public sphere was its separation from the power of both the church and the government due to its access to a variety of resources, both economic and social.\\nAs Habermas argues, in due course, this sphere of rational and universalistic politics, free from both the economy and the State, was destroyed by the same forces that initially established it. This collapse was due to the consumeristic drive that infiltrated society, so citizens became more concerned about consumption than political actions. Furthermore, the growth of capitalistic economy led to an uneven distribution of wealth, thus widening economic polarity. Suddenly the media became a tool of political forces and a medium for advertising rather than the medium from which the public got their information on political matters. This resulted in limiting access to the public sphere and the political control of the public sphere was inevitable for the modern capitalistic forces to operate and thrive in the competitive economy.\\n\\nTherewith emerged a new sort of influence, i.e., media power, which, used for purposes of manipulation, once and for all took care of the innocence of the principle of publicity. The public sphere, simultaneously restructured and dominated by the mass media, developed into an arena infiltrated by power in which, by means of topic selection and topical contributions, a battle is fought not only over influence but over the control of communication flows that affect behavior while their strategic intentions are kept hidden as much as possible.\\n\\n\\n== Counterpublics, feminist critiques and expansions ==\\nAlthough Structural Transformation was (and is) one of the most influential works in contemporary German philosophy and political science, it took 27 years until an English version appeared on the market in 1989. Based on a conference on the occasion of the English translation, at which Habermas himself attended, Craig Calhoun (1992) edited Habermas and the Public Sphere – a thorough dissection of Habermas\\' bourgeois public sphere by scholars from various academic disciplines. The core criticism at the conference was directed towards the above stated \"institutional criteria\":\\n\\nHegemonic dominance and exclusion: In \"Rethinking the Public Sphere,\" Nancy Fraser offers a feminist revision of Habermas\\' historical description of the public sphere, and confronts it with \"recent revisionist historiography\". She refers to other scholars, like Joan Landes, Mary P. Ryan and Geoff Eley, when she argues that the bourgeois public sphere was in fact constituted by a \"number of significant exclusions.\" In contrast to Habermas\\' assertions on disregard of status and inclusivity, Fraser claims that the bourgeois public sphere discriminated against women and other historically marginalized groups: \"... this network of clubs and associations – philanthropic, civic, professional, and cultural – was anything but accessible to everyone. On the contrary, it was the arena, the training ground and eventually the power base of a stratum of bourgeois men who were coming to see themselves as a \"universal class\" and preparing to assert their fitness to govern.\" Thus, she stipulates a hegemonic tendency of the male bourgeois public sphere, which dominated at the cost of alternative publics (for example by gender, social status, ethnicity and property ownership), thereby averting other groups from articulating their particular concerns.\\nBracketing of inequalities: Fraser makes us recall that \"the bourgeois conception of the public sphere requires bracketing inequalities of status\". The \"public sphere was to be an arena in which interlocutors would set aside such characteristics as a difference in birth and fortune and speak to one another as if they were social and economic peers\". Fraser refers to feminist research by Jane Mansbridge, which notes several relevant \"ways in which deliberation can serve as a mask for domination\". Consequently, she argues that \"such bracketing usually works to the advantage of dominant groups in society and to the disadvantage of subordinates.\" Thus, she concludes: \"In most cases, it would be more appropriate to unbracket inequalities in the sense of explicitly thematizing them – a point that accords with the spirit of Habermas\\' later communicative ethics\".\\nThe problematic definition of \"common concern\": Nancy Fraser points out that \"there are no naturally given, a priori boundaries\" between matters that are generally conceived as private, and ones we typically label as public (i.e. of \"common concern\"). As an example, she refers to the historic shift in the general conception of domestic violence, from previously being a matter of primarily private concern, to now generally being accepted as a common one: \"Eventually, after sustained discursive contestation we succeeded in making it a common concern\".\\n\\nNancy Fraser identified the fact that marginalized groups are excluded from a universal public sphere, and thus it was impossible to claim that one group would, in fact, be inclusive. However, she claimed that marginalized groups formed their own public spheres, and termed this concept a subaltern counter public or counter-public.\\nFraser worked from Habermas\\' basic theory because she saw it to be \"an indispensable resource\" but questioned the actual structure and attempted to address her concerns. She made the observation that \"Habermas stops short of developing a new, post-bourgeois model of the public sphere\". Fraser attempted to evaluate Habermas\\' bourgeois public sphere, discuss some assumptions within his model, and offer a modern conception of the public sphere.\\nIn the historical reevaluation of the bourgeois public sphere, Fraser argues that rather than opening up the political realm to everyone, the bourgeois public sphere shifted political power from \"a repressive mode of domination to a hegemonic one\". Rather than rule by power, there was now rule by the majority ideology. To deal with this hegemonic domination, Fraser argues that repressed groups form \"Subaltern counter-publics\" that are \"parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs\".\\nBenhabib notes that in Habermas\\' idea of the public sphere, the distinction between public and private issues separates issues that normally affect women (issues of \"reproduction, nurture and care for the young, the sick, and the elderly\") into the private realm and out of the discussion in the public sphere. She argues that if the public sphere is to be open to any discussion that affects the population, there cannot be distinctions between \"what is\" and \"what is not\" discussed. Benhabib argues for feminists to counter the popular public discourse in their own counter public.\\nThe public sphere was long regarded as men\\'s domain whereas women were supposed to inhabit the private domestic sphere. A distinct ideology that prescribed separate spheres for women and men emerged during the Industrial Revolution.\\nThe concept of heteronormativity is used to describe the way in which those who fall outside of the basic male/female dichotomy of gender or whose sexual orientations are other than heterosexual cannot meaningfully claim their identities, causing a disconnect between their public selves and their private selves. Michael Warner made the observation that the idea of an inclusive public sphere makes the assumption that we are all the same without judgments about our fellows. He argues that we must achieve some sort of disembodied state in order to participate in a universal public sphere without being judged. His observations point to a homosexual counter public, and offers the idea that homosexuals must otherwise remain \"closeted\" in order to participate in the larger public discourse.\\n\\n\\n== Rhetorical ==\\n\\nGerard Hauser proposed a different direction for the public sphere than previous models. He foregrounds the rhetorical nature of public spheres, suggesting that public spheres form around \"the ongoing dialogue on public issues\" rather than the identity of the group engaged in the discourse.\\nRather than arguing for an all-inclusive public sphere, or the analysis of tension between public spheres, he suggested that publics were formed by active members of society around issues. They are a group of interested individuals who engage in vernacular discourse about a specific issue. \"Publics may be repressed, distorted, or responsible, but any evaluation of their actual state requires that we inspect the rhetorical environment as well as the rhetorical act out of which they evolved, for these are the conditions that constitute their individual character\". These people formed rhetorical public spheres that were based in discourse, not necessarily orderly discourse but any interactions whereby the interested public engages each other. This interaction can take the form of institutional actors as well as the basic \"street rhetoric\" that \"open[s] a dialogue between competing factions.\" The spheres themselves formed around the issues that were being deliberated. The discussion itself would reproduce itself across the spectrum of interested publics \"even though we lack personal acquaintance with all but a few of its participants and are seldom in contexts where we and they directly interact, we join these exchanges because they are discussing the same matters\". In order to communicate within the public sphere, \"those who enter any given arena must share a reference world for their discourse to produce awareness for shared interests and public opinions about them\". This world consists of common meanings and cultural norms from which interaction can take place.\\n\\nThe rhetorical public sphere has several primary features:\\n\\nit is discourse-based, rather than class-based.\\nthe critical norms are derived from actual discursive practices. Taking a universal reasonableness out of the picture, arguments are judged by how well they resonate with the population that is discussing the issue.\\nintermediate bracketing of discursive exchanges. Rather than a conversation that goes on across a population as a whole, the public sphere is composed of many intermediate dialogs that merge later on in the discussion.\\nThe rhetorical public sphere was characterized by five rhetorical norms from which it can be gauged and criticized. How well the public sphere adheres to these norms determine the effectiveness of the public sphere under the rhetorical model. Those norms are:\\n\\npermeable boundaries: Although a public sphere may have a specific membership as with any social movement or deliberative assembly, people outside the group can participate in the discussion.\\nactivity: Publics are active rather than passive. They do not just hear the issue and applaud, but rather they actively engage the issue and the publics surrounding the issue.\\ncontextualized language: They require that participants adhere to the rhetorical norm of contextualized language to render their respective experiences intelligible to one another.\\nbelievable appearance: The public sphere must appear to be believable to each other and the outside public.\\ntolerance: In order to maintain a vibrant discourse, others opinions need to be allowed to enter the arena.\\nIn all this Hauser believes a public sphere is a \"discursive space in which strangers discuss issues they perceive to be of consequence for them and their group. Its rhetorical exchanges are the bases for shared awareness of common issues, shared interests, tendencies of extent and strength of difference and agreement, and self-constitution as a public whose opinions bear on the organization of society.\"\\nThis concept that the public sphere acts as a medium in which public opinion is formed as analogous to a lava lamp. Just as the lamp\\'s structure changes, with its lava separating and forming new shapes, so does the public sphere\\'s creation of opportunities for discourse to address public opinion, thereby forming new discussions of rhetoric. The lava of the public which holds together the public arguments is the public conversation.\\n\\n\\n== Media ==\\nHabermas argues that the public sphere requires \"specific means for transmitting information and influencing those who receive it\".\\nHabermas\\' argument shows that the media are of particular importance for constituting and maintaining a public sphere.  Discussions about the media have therefore been of particular importance in public sphere theory.\\n\\n\\n=== As actors in the political public sphere ===\\nAccording to Habermas, there are two types of actors without whom no political public sphere could be put to work: professionals in the media system and politicians.\\nFor Habermas, there are five types of actors who make their appearance on the virtual stage of an established public sphere:\\n\\n(a) Lobbyists who represent special interest groups;\\n(b) Advocates who either represent general interest groups or substitute for a lack of representation of marginalized groups that are unable to voice their interests effectively;\\n(c) Experts who are credited with professional or scientific knowledge in some specialized area and are invited to give advice;\\n(d) Moral entrepreneurs who generate public attention for supposedly neglected issues;\\n\\n(e) Intellectuals who have gained, unlike advocates or moral entrepreneurs, a perceived personal reputation in some field (e.g., as writers or academics) and who engage, unlike experts and lobbyists, spontaneously in public discourse with the declared intention of promoting general interests.\\nLibraries have been inextricably tied to educational institutions in the modern era having developed within democratic societies. Libraries took on aspects of the public sphere (as did classrooms), even while public spheres  transformed in the macro sense. These contextual conditions  led to a fundamental conservative rethinking of civil society institutions like schools and libraries.\\n\\n\\n=== YouTube ===\\nHabermas argues that under certain conditions, the media act to facilitate discourse in a public sphere. The rise of the Internet has brought about a resurgence of scholars applying theories of the public sphere to Internet technologies.\\nFor example, a study by S. Edgerly et al.\\nfocused on the ability of YouTube to serve as an online public sphere. The researchers examined a large sample of video comments using the California Proposition 8 (2008) as an example. The authors argue that some scholars think the online public sphere is a space where a wide range of voices can be expressed due to the \"low barrier of entry\" and interactivity. However, they also point at a number of limitations. Edgerly et al. say that the affirmative discourse presupposes that YouTube can be an influential player in the political process and that it can serve as an influential force to politically mobilize young people. YouTube has allowed anyone and everyone to be able to get any political knowledge they wish. The authors mention critiques that say YouTube is built around the popularity of videos with sensationalist content. It has also allowed people to broadcast themselves for a large public sphere, where people can form their own opinions and discuss different things in the comments. The research by Edgerly, et al. found that the analyzed YouTube comments were diverse. They argue that this is a possible indicator that YouTube provides space for public discussion. They also found that YouTube videos\\' style influences the nature of the commentary. Finally, they concluded that the video\\'s ideological stances influenced the language of the comments. The findings of the work suggest that YouTube is a public sphere platform.\\nAdditional work by S. Buckley  reflected on the role that news content, specifically US cable news, contributed towards the formation of the public sphere. His research analysed a total of 1239 videos uploaded by five news organisations and investigated the link between content and user engagement. Through both content and sentiment analysis, it was suggested that the sentiment of the language used in the titles of the videos had an impact upon the public, with negatively sentimented titles generated more user engagement. Buckley suggested that due to the aspect of emotionality that is present in news content that due to the ongoing process of media hybridization, a new conceptual framework of the public sphere that acknowledges how both thoughtful discussions as well as ones which express feelings in an overt way needs to be developed.\\n\\n\\n=== Limitations of media and the internet ===\\nSome, like Colin Sparks, note that a new global public sphere ought to be created in the wake of increasing globalization and global institutions, which operate at the supranational level. However, the key questions for him were, whether any media exists in terms of size and access to fulfil this role. The traditional media, he notes, are close to the public sphere in this true sense. Nevertheless, limitations are imposed by the market and concentration of ownership. At present, the global media fail to constitute the basis of a public sphere for at least three reasons. Similarly, he notes that the internet, for all its potential, does not meet the criteria for a public sphere and that unless these are \"overcome, there will be no sign of a global public sphere\".\\nGerman scholars Jürgen Gerhards and Mike S. Schäfer conducted a study in 2009 in order to establish whether the Internet offers a better and broader communication environment compared to quality newspapers. They analyzed how the issue of human genome research was portrayed between 1999 and 2001 in popular quality newspapers in both Germany and the United States in comparison to the way it appeared on search engines at the time of their research. Their intention was to analyze what actors and what sort of opinions the subject generated in both print and the Internet and verify whether the online space proved to be a more democratic public sphere, with a wider range of sources and views. Gerhards and Schäfer say they have found \"only minimal evidence to support the idea that the internet is a better communication space as compared to print media\". \"In both media, communication is dominated by (bio- and natural) scientific actors; popular inclusion does not occur\". The scholars argue that the search algorithms select the sources of information based on the popularity of their links. \"Their gatekeeping, in contrast to the old mass media, relies mainly on technical characteristics of websites\".   For Gerhards and Schäfer the Internet is not an alternative public sphere because less prominent voices end up being silenced by the search engines\\' algorithms. \"Search engines might actually silence societal debate by giving more space to established actors and institutions\". Another tactic that supports this view is astroturfing. The Guardian columnist George Monbiot said that Astroturfing software, \"has the potential to destroy the internet as a forum for constructive debate. It jeopardizes the notion of online democracy\".\\n\\n\\n=== Virtual ===\\nThere has been an academic debate about how social media impacts the public sphere. The sociologists Brian Loader and Dan Mercea give an overview of this discussion. They argue that social media offers increasing opportunities for political communication and enable democratic capacities for political discussion within the virtual public sphere. The effect would be that citizens could challenge governments and corporations\\' political and economic power. Additionally, new forms of political participation and information sources for the users emerge with the Internet that can be used, for example, in online campaigns.\\nHowever, the two authors point out that social media\\'s dominant uses are entertainment, consumerism, and content sharing among friends. Loader and Mercea point out that \"individual preferences reveal an unequal spread of social ties with a few giant nodes such as Google, Yahoo, Facebook and YouTube attracting the majority of users\". They also stress that some critics have voiced the concern that there is a lack of seriousness in political communication on social media platforms. Moreover, lines between professional media coverage and user-generated content would blur on social media.\\nThe authors conclude that social media provides new opportunities for political participation; however, they warn users of the risks of accessing unreliable sources. The Internet impacts the virtual public sphere in many ways, but is not a free utopian platform as some observers argued at the beginning of its history.\\n\\n\\n=== Mediated publicness ===\\nJohn Thompson criticises the traditional idea of public sphere by Habermas, as it is centred mainly in face-to-face interactions. On the contrary, Thompson argues that modern society is characterized by a new form of \"mediated publicness\", whose main characteristics are:\\n\\nDespatialized (there is a rupture of time/space. People can see more things, as they do not need to share the same physical location, but this extended vision always has an angle, which people do not have control over).\\nNon dialogical (unidirectional. For example, presenters on TV are not able to adapt their discourse to the reactions of the audience, since they are visible to a wide audience but that audience is not directly visible to them. However, internet allows a bigger interactivity).\\nWider and more diverse audiences. (The same message can reach people with different education, different social class, different values and beliefs, and so on.)\\nThis mediated publicness has altered the power relations in a way in which not only the many are visible to the few but the few can also now see the many:\\n\\n \"Whereas the Panopticon renders many people visible to a few and enables power to be exercised over the many by subjecting them to a state of permanent visibility, the development of communication media provides a means by which many people can gather information about a few and, at the same time, a few can appear before many; thanks to the media, it is primarily those who exercise power, rather than those over whom power is exercised, who are subjected to a certain kind of visibility\".  \\nHowever, Thompson also acknowledges that \"media and visibility is a double-edged sword\" meaning that even though they can be used to show an improved image (by managing the visibility), individuals are not in full control of their self-presentation. Mistakes, gaffes or scandals are now recorded therefore they are harder to deny, as they can be replayed by the media.\\n\\n\\n=== The public service model ===\\nExamples of the public service model include BBC in Britain, and the ABC and SBS in Australia. The political function and effect of modes of public communication has traditionally continued with the dichotomy between Hegelian State and civil society. The dominant theory of this mode includes the liberal theory of the free press. However, the public service, state-regulated model, whether publicly or privately funded, has always been seen not as a positive good but as an unfortunate necessity imposed by the technical limitations of frequency scarcity.\\nAccording to Habermas\\'s concept of the public sphere,  the strength of this concept is that it identifies and stresses the importance for democratic politics of a sphere distinct from the economy and the State. On the other hand, this concept challenges the liberal free press tradition form the grounds of its materiality, and it challenges the Marxist critique of that tradition from the grounds of the specificity of politics as well.\\nFrom Garnham\\'s critique, three great virtues of Habermas\\'s public sphere are mentioned. Firstly, it focuses on the indissoluble like between the institutions and practices of mass public communication and the institutions and practices of democratic politics. The second virtue of Habermas\\'s approach concentrate on the necessary material resource base for ant public. Its third virtue is to escape from the simple dichotomy of free market versus state control that dominates so much thinking about media policy.\\n\\n\\n== Non-liberal theories ==\\nOskar Negt & Alexander Kluge  took a non-liberal view of public spheres, and argued that Habermas\\' reflections on the bourgeois public sphere should be supplemented with reflections on the proletarian public spheres and the public spheres of production.\\n\\n\\n=== Proletarian ===\\nThe distinction between bourgeois and proletarian public spheres is not mainly a distinction between classes. The proletarian public sphere is rather to be conceived of as the \"excluded\", vague, unarticulated impulses of resistance or resentment. The proletarian public sphere carries the subjective feelings, the egocentric malaise with the common public narrative, interests that are not socially valorized\\n\\n\"As extraeconomic interests, they exist—precisely in the forbidden zones of fantasy beneath the surface of taboos—as stereotypes of a proletarian context of living that is organized in a merely rudimentary form.\"\\nThe bourgeois and proletarian public spheres are mutually defining: The proletarian public sphere carries the \"left-overs\" from the bourgeois public sphere, while the bourgeois public is based upon the productive forces of the underlying resentment:\\n\\n\"In this respect, they \" [i.e. the proletarian public spheres] \" have two characteristics: in their defensive attitude toward society, their conservatism, and their subcultural character, they are once again mere objects; but they are, at the same time, the block of real life that goes against the valorization interest. As long as capital is dependent on living labor as a source of wealth, this element of the proletarian context of living cannot be extinguished through repression.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Production ===\\nNegt and Kluge furthermore point out the necessity of considering a third dimension of the public spheres: The public spheres of production. The public spheres of production collect the impulses of resentment and instrumentalizes them in the productive spheres. The public spheres of production are wholly instrumental and have no critical impulse (unlike the bourgeois and proletarian spheres). The interests that are incorporated in the public sphere of production are given capitalist shape, and questions of their legitimately are thus neutralized.\\n\\n\\n=== Biopolitical public ===\\nBy the end of the 20th century, the discussions about public spheres got a new biopolitical twist. Traditionally the public spheres had been contemplated as to how free agents transgress the private spheres. Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have, drawing on the late Michel Foucault\\'s writings on biopolitics, suggested that we reconsider the very distinction between public and private spheres. They argue that the traditional distinction is founded on a certain (capitalist) account of property that presupposes clear-cut separations between interests. This account of property is (according to Hardt and Negri) based upon a scarcity economy. The scarcity economy is characterized by an impossibility of sharing the goods. If \"agent A\" eats the bread, \"agent B\" cannot have it. The interests of agents are thus, generally, clearly separated.\\nHowever, with the evolving shift in the economy towards an informational materiality, in which value is based upon the informational significance, or the narratives surrounding the products, the clear-cut subjective separation is no longer obvious. Hardt and Negri see the open source approaches as examples of new ways of co-operation that illustrate how economic value is not founded upon exclusive possession, but rather upon collective potentialities. Informational materiality is characterized by gaining value only through being shared. Hardt and Negri thus suggest that the commons become the focal point of analyses of public relations. The point being that with this shift it becomes possible to analyse how the very distinctions between the private and public are evolving.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nArgumentation theory\\nCommons\\nInterpersonal relationship\\nOnline deliberation\\nProtest\\nPublic place\\nProject for Public Spaces\\nPublic hypersphere\\nThe Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article (1964)\\nRes publica\\nRule according to higher law\\nRichard Sennett\\nThe Lives of Others – A film that describes the monitoring of the cultural scene of East Berlin by agents of the Stasi during the Cold War\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nPublic Sphere Guide, a research and teaching guide, and resource for the renewal of the Public Sphere\\nTransformations of the Public Sphere Essay Forum\\nJürgen Habermas, \"The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article,\" New German Critique 3 (1974)\\nSpark summary of Habermas\\' public sphere book'),\n",

The project was initially a partnership between the Madison Square Garden Company (MSG) and Las Vegas Sands Corporation. Sphere is just off the Las Vegas Strip and east of the Venetian resort, which was opened by Las Vegas Sands in 1999. Las Vegas Sands contributed the 18-acre (7.3 ha) site for the project. Apollo Global Management purchased the Venetian in 2022 and became MSG\\'s new partner on the Sphere project, replacing Las Vegas Sands. As part of the sale, the land beneath the Venetian Resort and Sphere was purchased by Vici Properties.\\nThe sphere-shaped project was designed by Populous, with an interior that includes the world\\'s largest LED screen. MSG initially estimated the project cost at $1.2 billion. In February 2020, the company said the cost had increased to $1.66 billion as a result of design changes consisting of guest enhancements. The cost continued to increase, eventually surpassing $2 billion due to the 2021–2023 global supply chain crisis and the 2021–2022 inflation surge. With a final expected cost of $2.3 billion, it is the most expensive entertainment venue in Las Vegas history, beating out the $1.9 billion Allegiant Stadium.\\n\\n\\n=== Construction ===\\nA groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 27, 2018, and was attended by approximately 300 people, including Las Vegas Sands\\' Sheldon Adelson and Nevada governor Brian Sandoval. In November 2018, it was reported that the MSG Sphere would be built along with new bars, private suites, a museum and retail space. AECOM began working on the site in February 2019, through a preliminary agreement. AECOM had worked on several other stadiums, including the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Excavation was underway in March 2019. Approximately 110,000 cubic yards (84,000 m3) of dirt and caliche were excavated to prepare the site for construction. AECOM was named as the general contractor in June 2019. The project had 400 construction workers. This number was expected to eventually reach a peak of 1,500. Construction of the basement was underway in July 2019.\\nBy October 2019, construction crews had completed the 80,000 sq ft (7,400 m2) basement as well as the first ground level of the venue. The basement area will be used as public space for events. Excavation went as deep as 21 feet (6.4 m) for construction of the basement. In December 2019, the spherical structure reached 65 feet (20 m) in height with the completion of a fourth level, out of eight above-ground floors.\\nIn February 2020, the world\\'s fourth-largest crane, a Demag CC-8800 crawler crane, was set up on the site\\'s northeast side for the purpose of lifting heavy construction materials. The crane is capable of standing up to 580 feet (180 m). In a disassembled state, the crane was transported across the Atlantic Ocean from Zeebrugge, Belgium to Port Hueneme, California. The crane then required 120 tractor-trailers to transport it to Las Vegas. A separate crane was required to assemble the main crane, a process which took 18 days. In March 2020, construction reached the widest point of the spherical structure, the 516-foot (157 m) diameter, located at the sixth level and 108 feet (33 m) above ground.\\nThe project had been scheduled to open in 2021. However, MSG announced on March 31, 2020, that construction would be suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project experienced a disruption in its supply chain, a result of the pandemic, and this hindered construction progress. All construction work on the project was expected to come to a stop over the next two weeks following the announcement. In August 2020, MSG Entertainment announced that construction had resumed on the project, with the opening rescheduled for 2023. Over the subsequent 15 months, construction would be focused on concrete, followed by steel erection and then the 13,000-ton steel-domed roof, the most complex part of the project. In October 2020, crews completed the heaviest lift up to that point, with the installation of two 240-ton steel girders.\\nMSG took over as general contractor in December 2020, although AECOM continued to provide support. A 170-ton steel compression ring was added in February 2021, marking the heaviest lift of the entire project. Due to its size, the ring had to be assembled at the construction site. Work crews spent three weeks welding and bolting the prefabricated steel pieces together, and the crane was then used to lift the ring into place.\\n\\n\\n==== Roof, exosphere, and interior ====\\n\\nThe dome\\'s roof required 3,000 tons of steel. The roof started to take shape in March 2021, as crews began the installation of 32 trusses, each one weighing 100 tons. Truss installation reached the midway point in May 2021, and the crane had to be moved to the southern side of the property to install the remainder. Because of its size, the crane\\'s relocation took two days.\\nThe dome was topped off on June 18, 2021, and work was already underway on an external exosphere which would be built around the dome. The exosphere is made of LED light panels which are visible from several miles away and is 30 percent taller than the dome. Work on Sphere\\'s interior began in August 2021.\\nUpon completion of the roof\\'s steel frame, 6,000 cubic yards (4,600 m3) of concrete were then pumped onto the roof. This formed a layer measuring 10 inches (250 mm) in thickness, and weighing approximately 10,000 tons. The roof was finished in October 2021. Crews then turned their focus to the 730-ton steel interior frame which supports the LED screens and audio system. Work on the interior frame continued into 2022.\\nA second topping out, for the exosphere, took place on May 24, 2022. This was followed by installation of the interior and exterior LED screens. The latter was illuminated for the first time on July 4, 2023, during Independence Day celebrations. Sphere soon went viral for its display of images.\\n\\n\\n=== Opening ===\\n\\nOn April 20, 2023, the venue\\'s owner Madison Square Garden Entertainment (which had, in turn, been spun off from the Madison Square Garden Company in 2020 in order to focus on its professional sports assets) spun off its \"traditional\" live events business under the Madison Square Garden Entertainment name in order to insulate them, retaining Sphere and its regional sports network businesses under the new name Sphere Entertainment. The MSG name was subsequently removed from the venue, which was officially renamed \"Sphere\". \\nSphere opened on September 29, 2023, with the opening of U2\\'s concert residency U2:UV Achtung Baby Live at Sphere. It marked the group\\'s first live show since 2019. Sphere plans on hosting four to six residencies each year. The company also debuted its first feature film, Postcard from Earth by director Darren Aronofsky, at Sphere on October 6, 2023. The venue will employ up to 3,000 people. Since opening, Sphere operated at a $98.4 million loss at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2023. In 2024, Sphere grossed $420.5 million from 1.3 million concert tickets sold, ranking as the top-grossing venue of any size that year; it is the highest annual gross of any venue in Billboard Boxscore history.\\n\\n\\n== Features ==\\n\\n\\n=== Structure and seating ===\\n\\nSphere is 366 feet (112 m) high and 516 feet (157 m) wide at its broadest point. It is the largest spherical building in the world at 875,000 sq ft (81,300 m2). It includes seating for 18,600 people, and all seats have high-speed internet access. The venue can accommodate 20,000 people in standing capacity. Seating does not wrap around the entire sphere, instead covering approximately two-thirds of the interior while the stage takes up the remainder. Approximately 800 seats in the venue\\'s premium, lower-level 100 section have obstructed views of the wraparound video screen due to the overhang of the second level. Sphere has nine levels, including the basement, where a VIP club is located. A total of 23 suites are included, across the third and fifth floors.\\nThe arena will primarily host award shows and concerts, in addition to other entertainment events. Though not designed to fit a traditional arena layout for sports such as basketball and ice hockey, it can host ring sports events such as boxing and mixed martial arts, as well as esports tournaments.\\n\\n\\n=== Video screens ===\\n\\nThe venue is equipped with a 160,000-square-foot (15,000 m2) LED screen that wraps around the interior. It was designed and manufactured by SACO Technologies, a Canadian company based in Montreal specializing in LED video displays and lighting. With a 16,000 × 16,000 resolution, it is the highest-resolution LED screen in the world, according to Sphere Entertainment. In describing the number of pixels on screen, media sources have reported figures ranging from 189 to 254 million diodes to 268,435,456 pixels. The screen consists of 64,000 LED panels, each controlled by a printed circuit board housed in an aluminum frame, with the panels manufactured in 780 different geometric shapes with an edge-to-edge tolerance of 0.8 millimetres (0.031 in). Due to its curved shape and the propensity for pixels to disappear near the poles, the screen uses an adaptive pixel pitch. It was also designed to be acoustically transparent, allowing sound from the speakers mounted behind the screen to pass through.\\nThe building\\'s exosphere features a 580,000-square-foot (54,000 m2) LED display also designed by SACO Technologies; it was the world\\'s largest at the time the venue opened. It comprises 1.23 million puck-shaped LEDs spaced 8 inches (20 cm) apart, each containing 48 diodes. Visuals displayed on the exosphere have included a Halloween jack-o\\'-lantern, a Christmas snow globe, and advertisements. \\nThe internal and external displays of Sphere are powered by 150 RTX A6000 graphics processing units by Nvidia, each featuring more than 10,752 cores and 48 gigabytes of memory. Media is streamed from external sources via Nvidia BlueField data processing units and ConnectX-6 DX network interface controllers using Nvidia\\'s Rivermax media streaming software.\\n\\n\\n=== Sound system ===\\n\\nSphere\\'s sound system, dubbed \"Sphere Immersive Sound\", features spatial audio capabilities and is based on Holoplot\\'s X1 Matrix Array of speakers. The sound system comprises 1,586 permanently installed speakers and 300 mobile modules, with 99 percent of the system being hidden behind the LED screen. Each X1 array comprises a MD96 and a MD80-S sound module, equipped with 96 and 80 drivers respectively. Through a matrix of drivers within each speaker module and a matrix of modules per array, Holoplot\\'s system offers more control over the dispersion of sound in horizontal and vertical directions. In total, the sound system comprises 167,000 speaker drivers, amplifiers, and processing channels, and it weighs 395,120 pounds (179,220 kg). The main coverage of the sound system is provided by the \"proscenium array\", located in Sphere where a traditional theatre proscenium would be built. It comprises 464 Holoplot X1 speakers (272 MD96 modules and 192 MD80-S modules) organized into 14 clusters and arranged in a semi-arch about 25–30 feet (7.6–9.1 m) above the stage, making it the world\\'s largest loudspeaker array. Elsewhere, the sound system has 28 environmental arrays for immersive coverage (each one comprising five MD96 and five MD80-S modules), 6 effects arrays (each one comprising 24 MD96 modules), 71 surround arrays behind the audience, 12 delay arrays under the main balcony, 10 side-fill arrays, and 6 low-fill arrays. The sound system also can deliver sound through the floorboards.\\nUsing beamforming capabilities, the Holoplot X1 speakers can digitally aim sound at specific spots in the audience and deliver a consistent volume to every seat in the venue, even over long distances; in Sphere, the system offers 110 metres (360 ft) of sound coverage to reach the furthest seats. The Holoplot X1 arrays can also use wave field synthesis to create a virtual point of origin for sound waves and to place them in precise spatial locations, regardless of the actual positions of speakers. Software algorithms compensate for any transmission loss caused by the obstruction from the LED screen. Integrated into the Holoplot X1 modules are several technologies by Powersoft, including 16-channel amplification, \"Integrated Powered Adaptive Loudspeaker\" for subwoofers, and energy-efficient solutions such as pulse-width modulation and \"power factor correction\".\\n\\n\\n=== 4D effects ===\\nSphere contains 4D features, including scent and wind, along with haptic technology in 10,000 of the venue\\'s seats.\\n\\n\\n=== Transportation ===\\nThe property includes 304 parking spaces, while additional spaces will be available at the parking garages for the nearby Venetian, Palazzo, and Venetian Expo. A 1,000-foot (300 m) pedestrian bridge connects Sphere to the expo, and there are plans to build a new Las Vegas Monorail station to serve Sphere and the Venetian. However, these plans were put on hold in April 2020, due to the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\n\\n== Events ==\\n\\n\\n=== Concerts ===\\n\\n\\n=== Films ===\\nThe film Postcard from Earth, directed by Darren Aronofsky, debuted on October 6, 2023. The show is preceded by the \"Sphere Experience\", a demonstration of the venue\\'s capabilities that utilizes animatronic robots and holographs.\\nV-U2 An Immersive Concert Film, which documents U2\\'s residency at Sphere, was released on September 5, 2024. It was directed by Morleigh Steinberg and her husband, U2 guitarist the Edge.\\n\\n\\n=== Sports ===\\nThe 2024 NHL Entry Draft took place at Sphere from June 28–29, 2024. The first live sporting event at Sphere was held on September 14, 2024, with MMA promotion UFC hosting UFC 306 (marketed as Riyadh Season Noche UFC for sponsorship reasons). Mexican-American filmmaker Carlos López Estrada oversaw the production of six vignettes played on the screens throughout the main card, which were themed on the history of Mexico. The screens then displayed immersive \"scenes\" as backdrops for each match.\\n\\n\\n=== Keynotes and other events ===\\nThe first keynote event, held on June 18, 2024, as part of the HPE Discover 2024 conference, was given by Hewlett Packard Enterprise president and CEO Antonio Neri; he was joined by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\\nDelta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian delivered a keynote during CES on January 7, 2025.\\n\\n\\n== Other locations ==\\nMSG had initially stated that it intends to build other Sphere venues around the world.\\nA similar MSG Sphere was planned to be built in Stratford, East London. However, in November 2023, Sphere\\'s planning permission was rejected by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, primarily over concerns about potential light pollution. The Tees Valley Mayor, Ben Houchen, suggested Teesside in North East England as an alternative venue for Sphere.\\nIn December 2023, MSG was discussing building of a new venue to be used for K-pop concerts in Hanam, South Korea. After discussions stalled for South Korea and also Saudi Arabia, MSG was in talks with developers in United Arab Emirates to build a second location in Abu Dhabi. On October 15, 2024, Sphere Entertainment confirmed that a second Sphere, identical to the one in Las Vegas, would be built in Abu Dhabi.\\n\\n\\n== Sphere Studios ==\\nSphere Studios, originally MSG Sphere Studios, opened in Burbank, California, in May 2022. The facility handles production and post-production work for the Las Vegas sphere and future spheres. MSG Sphere Studios sought to collaborate with filmmakers and musicians to create some of the content for the Las Vegas sphere. Ted King, who previously worked on Star Trek: The Experience, is among those who will create visual content for Sphere in Las Vegas. The studio will also produce content in association with the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix, which will travel past Sphere.\\nThe spherical studio facility, nearly 100 feet (30 m) tall, is a miniature version of the Las Vegas sphere. The facility uses Big Sky, a specialized camera system created specifically to produce material for Sphere.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nAvicii Arena\\nCinematic virtual reality\\nCinéorama, similar to Sphere\\nCinerama Dome\\nFulldome\\nExtended reality\\nIMAX\\nImmersion (virtual reality)\\nOn-set virtual production\\nSpaceship Earth (Epcot)\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website \\nCorporate website'),\n",

Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft) is a 1962 book by the philosopher Jürgen Habermas. It was translated into English in 1989 by Thomas Burger and Frederick Lawrence. An important contribution to modern understanding of democracy, it is notable for \"transforming media studies into a hard-headed discipline.\" In 2022 Habermas published a brief sequel, A New Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere and Deliberative Politics.\\n\\n\\n== The public sphere ==\\nAccording to Habermas, the notion of the \"public sphere\" began evolving during the Renaissance in Western Europe. Brought on partially by merchants\\' need for accurate information about distant markets as well as by the growth of democracy and individual liberty and popular sovereignty, the public sphere was a place between private individuals and government authorities in which people could meet and have critical debates about public matters. Such discussions served as a counterweight to political authority and happened physically in face-to-face meetings in coffee houses and cafes and public squares as well as in the media in letters, books, drama, and art. Habermas saw a vibrant public sphere as a positive force keeping authorities within bounds lest their rulings be ridiculed. According to the journalist David Randall, \"In Habermasian theory, the bourgeois public sphere was preceded by a literary public sphere whose favored genres revealed the interiority of the self and emphasized an audience-oriented subjectivity.\" \\n\\n\\n== Habermas\\' thesis ==\\n\\nThe Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere was Habermas\\'s first major work. It also satisfied the rigorous requirements for a professorship in Germany; in this system, independent scholarly research, usually resulting in a published book, must be submitted, and defended before an academic committee; this process is known as Habilitationsschrift or habilitation. The work was overseen by the political scientist Wolfgang Abendroth, to whom Habermas dedicated it. Habermas describes the development of a bourgeois public sphere in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries as well as its subsequent decline.\\nThe first transition occurred in England, France, the United States, and Germany over the course of 150 years or so from the late seventeenth century. England led the way in the early eighteenth century, with Germany following in the late eighteenth century. Habermas tries to explain the growth and decline of the public sphere by relating political, social, cultural and philosophical developments to each other in a multi-disciplinary approach. Initially, there were monarchical and feudal societies which made no distinction between state and society or between public and private, and which had organized themselves politically around symbolic representation and status. These feudal societies were transformed into a bourgeois liberal constitutional order which distinguished between the public and private realms; further, within the private realm, there was a bourgeois public sphere for rational-critical political debate which formed a new phenomenon called public opinion. Spearheading this shift was the growth of a literary public sphere in which the bourgeoisie learned to critically reflect upon itself and its role in society. This first major shift occurred alongside the rise of early non-industrial capitalism and the philosophical articulation of political liberalism by such thinkers as Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu (See: The Spirit of the Laws), Rousseau, and then Kant. The bourgeois public sphere flourished within the early laissez-faire, free-market, largely pre-industrial capitalist order of liberalism from the late eighteenth century to the mid-nineteenth century.\\nThe second part of Habermas\\' account traces the transition from the liberal bourgeois public sphere to the modern mass society of the social welfare state. Starting in the 1830s, extending from the late nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, a new constellation of social, cultural, political, and philosophical developments took shape. Hegel\\'s critique of Kant\\'s liberal philosophy anticipated the shift, according to Habermas, and this shift came to a philosophical head in Marx\\'s astute diagnosis of the contradictions inherent in the liberal constitutional social order. Habermas saw the modified liberalism of Mill and Tocqueville with their ambivalence toward the public sphere as emblematic manifestations of these contradictions.\\nParalleling this philosophical progression against classical liberalism were major socio-economic transformations based on industrialization, and the result was the rise of mass societies characterized by consumer capitalism in the twentieth century. Clear demarcations between public and private and between state and society became blurred. The bourgeois public sphere was transformed by the increasing re-integration and entwining of state and society that resulted in the modern social welfare state. This shift, according to Habermas, can be seen as part of a larger dialectic in which political changes were made in an attempt to save the liberal constitutional order, but had the ultimate effect of destroying the bourgeois public sphere. He highlights the pernicious effects of commercialization and consumerization on the public sphere through the rise of mass media, public relations, and consumer culture. He delineates how these developments thwarted rational-critical political debate, including political parties functioning in a way that bypassed the public sphere, undermining parliamentary politics.\\nHabermas drew on the cultural critiques of critical theory from the Frankfurt School, which included important thinkers such as Theodor Adorno, who was one of his teachers at the Institute for Social Research from 1956 to 1959. Habermas began his habilitation during this period, but due to intellectual tensions with the Institute\\'s director, philosopher and sociologist Max Horkheimer, he moved to the University of Marburg, where he completed the work under Wolfgang Abendroth.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n The book was reprinted many times in German and other languages, and has been enormously influential, especially since its translation into English, for scholars of political science, media studies, and rhetoric. It is also an important work for historians of philosophy and scholars of intellectual history. After publication, Habermas was identified as an important philosopher of the twentieth century.\\nSince publication, the Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere has been critiqued for Habermas’s formulation of the concept of a public sphere which he claimed \"stood or fell with the principle of universal access ... A public sphere from which specific groups would be eo ipso excluded was less than merely incomplete; it was not a public sphere at all.\" (Habermas 1962:85) However, the bourgeois public sphere required as preconditions of entry an excellent education and property ownership – which correlated to membership of the upper classes. Critics have argued that the bourgeois public sphere cannot be considered an ideal form of politics, since the public sphere was limited to upper-class strata of society and did not represent most of the citizens in these emerging nation-states.\\nSome critics claim the public sphere, as such, never existed, or existed only in the sense of excluding many important groups, such as the poor, women, slaves, migrants, and criminals. They maintain that the public sphere remains an idealized conception, little changed since Kant, since the ideal is still to a great extent what Habermas might call an unfinished project of modernity. (Cubitt 2005:93)\\nSimilar critiques regarding the exclusivity of the bourgeois public sphere have been made by feminist and post-colonial authors.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\nHabermas, Jürgen (1962 trans 1989) The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a category of Bourgeois Society, Polity, Cambridge.

      "('Source: The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere\\nContent: == The public sphere ==\\n\\nSource: Public sphere pedagogy\\nContent: === Public sphere theory ===\\n\\nSource: European public sphere\\nContent: == Definition ==\\nThe public sphere is defined by Jürgen Habermas as a space \"made up of private people gathered together as a public and articulating the needs of society with the state\". This public space allows for different opinions to be expressed, problems to be discussed and collective solutions to be developed. The public sphere is a place of debates that Silke Adam identifies as the \"link between politicians and citizens, which can be strengthened by the media\"\\n\\nSource: Public sphere\\nContent: The public sphere (German: Öffentlichkeit) is an area in social life where individuals can come together to freely discuss and identify societal problems, and through that discussion influence political action.

      "1. **Mass media**: The public sphere often relies on mass media, such as newspapers, television, and radio, to disseminate information and facilitate public debate.\n",
      "2. **Public institutions**: Public institutions, such as government, parliament, and civil society organizations, play a crucial role in shaping the public sphere.\n",

      "Yes, John Rawls has responded to criticisms of his theory of justice, including those related to public reason and the role of individual rights. Here are some key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Public Reason**: Rawls' concept of public reason is closely tied to his theory of justice as fairness. He argues that public reason involves justifying a particular position by way of reasons that people of different moral or political backgrounds could accept. This means that public reason must be grounded in a shared understanding of the common good and the principles of justice.\n",
      "2. **Burdens of Judgment**: Rawls acknowledges that there are burdens of judgment, which can produce disagreement among reasonable citizens. However, he argues that these burdens can be overcome through the use of public reason and the application of rational deliberation.\n",
      "3. **Individual Rights**: Rawls' theory of justice as fairness is based on the idea that individuals have inherent rights and dignity. He argues that these rights are fundamental to human equality and should be protected by the principles of justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to criticisms, such as those raised by Robert Nozick in \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\", Rawls has argued:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The role of the state**: Rawls believes that a just society requires a minimal state that protects individual rights and freedoms. He argues that this is necessary to ensure that individuals can exercise their rational faculties and engage in public reason.\n",
      "2. **The importance of social justice**: Rawls emphasizes the importance of social justice, which involves addressing the inequalities and injustices that exist within society. He argues that a just society must prioritize the well-being of the least advantaged members of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some key texts that discuss these issues include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **\"A Theory of Justice\" (1971)**: This book outlines Rawls' theory of justice as fairness and provides a detailed argument for his conception of public reason.\n",
      "2. **\"Justice as Fairness: Political Not Metaphysical\" (2005)**: This paper provides an overview of Rawls' theory of justice and responds to criticisms from various philosophers, including Nozick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Rawls' theory of justice emphasizes the importance of public reason, social justice, and individual rights. While he acknowledges that there are burdens of judgment, he argues that these can be overcome through rational deliberation and the application of shared principles of justice.\n"
